In this context, stakeholders need indicators that both provide a synthetic view of the state of biodiversity and can be used as communication tools. Using river fishes as model, we developed community indicators that aim at integrating various components of biodiversity including interactions between species and ultimately the processes influencing ecosystem functions. We developed indices at the species level based on (i) the concept of specialization directly linked to the niche theory and (ii) the concept of originality measuring the overall degree of differences between a species and all other species in the same clade. Five major types of originality indices, based on phylogeny, habitat-linked and diet-linked morphology, life history traits, and ecological niche were analyzed. In a second step, we tested the relationship between all biodiversity indices and land use as a proxy of human pressures. Fish communities showed no significant temporal trend for most of these indices, but both originality indices based on diet- and habitat- linked morphology showed a significant increase through time. From a spatial point of view, all indices clearly singled out Corsica Island as having higher average originality and specialization. Finally, we observed that the originality index based on niche traits might be used as an informative biodiversity indicator because we showed it is sensitive to different land use classes along a landscape artificialization gradient. Moreover, its response remained unchanged over two other land use classifications at the global scale and also at the regional scale.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>&#x0201c;D&#x000e9;partement &#x000c9;volution et Diversit&#x000e9; Biologique&#x0201d; (EDB) is part of the "Laboratoire d&#x02019;Excellence" (LABEX) entitled TULIP (ANR-10-LABX-41), ONEMA - Officie National des Eaux et des Milieux Aquatiques."

Even though this target was not achieved (the new target is 2020), research in the field of biodiversity indicators has been growing during the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. </p><p>As biodiversity is a complex object and subject, a first step for improving conservation plans is to build indices, which are intended to synthesize and simplify data in quantitative terms. Indices vary depending on the biological level quantified, i.e. from genes to biomes. Such a variety of biodiversity levels respond to the numerous ways of examining biodiversity, as defined by the Convention of Biological Diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As indices quantify an aspect of biodiversity, they can become useful indicators if they tell us about the impact of human pressures on biodiversity. Facing global changes, species responses are not uniform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although a few species are not negatively affected by human activity and are flourishing, many are declining or will become extinct in the next century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this sense, the evaluation of biodiversity needs to move away from a reliance on species lists and case-by-case approaches to give a more global picture of what happens for most species in an ecosystem. </p><p>Up until ten years ago, all river ecosystem indicators were assessed on their hydromorphological, chemical, and biological characteristics (e.g. <italic>IBGN</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] or <italic>EPT</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). Because of their ability to integrate environmental variability at different spatial scales, fish assemblages have been studied and new indicators of river ecosystems have been developed (e.g. <italic>IPR</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). Although these indicators encompass the relative importance of geographic, ecoregional, and local factors, they were developed using the reference condition of pristine ecosystems without human impacts. As Baker and King (2013) point out, there is a crucial need for new aquatic indicators based on other criteria than biotic indices or summary metrics (e.g. taxon richness, ordination scores) especially in assessment and management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Here, we develop a new approach, specifically dedicated to evaluate different functional approaches of fish biodiversity. It is the first study to synthesize comparisons between a large variety of fish traits: life history traits, morphological traits linked to habitat or diet, habitat niche, and an integrative approach based on abiotic habitat specialization. </p><p>Community indices consider upper biological organization levels beyond the species level. They take into account the relationship between species inside the community, sometimes explicitly, such as in trophic networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and sometimes implicitly, such as in niche or habitat specialization approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Even if all community indices are species-based, they incorporate more complexity than species indicators because of these interactive approaches. They thus correspond more closely to a primary objective for indicators, producing a synthetic representation of biodiversity. Indeed, these indicators should help tackle the problem of maintaining the entire community integrity despite global changes by providing decision makers with more accurate information about human impacts on a global scale. In this respect, they are closer to the steady-state perspective, a frequently mentioned policy objective. It is easy to address the functional facet of biodiversity in this way and quite popular nowadays in the ecosystem &#x0201c;services&#x0201d; context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, basic summary metrics at the community level lose valuable information and non-linear declines should be undetected with aggregate responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In function of the study objectives it may be important, especially in conservation, to analyze the dataset species by species (or see TITAN, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]) and it is always helpful to carefully interpret the community results. </p><p>Finally, the criterion to create an indicator is to build good communication tools that are easy to understand and friendly to use, adapted to the context and scale of needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Indicators provide information to fuel dialogue between different scientific disciplines and stakeholders involved in biodiversity conservation. However, indicators also try to reach new targets identified as extremely important for the preservation of biodiversity. Indicators in this case attempt to open a dialogue and convince people not already involved in conservation including policy makers (local to international), judges, industrials, and farmers.</p><p>In this paper we aim to develop indices to better understand functional patterns in space and time of river fish communities and to evaluate their potential as biodiversity indicators for environmental policy makers. </p><p>First, we quantified the spatial and temporal changes in composition of French fish communities with two different approaches: originality and specialization indices. For the originality indices, we used four sets of functional traits (habitat niche, life history, diet-linked morphology, and habitat-linked morphology) and the phylogeny to obtain five matrices for the twenty-six common fish species considered. We first used the metric of originality defined as the rarity of species traits to obtain scores for each species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, the whole contribution of species to trait community depends on its originality. More precisely, as integrative community-traits indices, we computed the average value of the originality score depending on the density of species locally present. The second approach was based on niche theory and species specialization such as it has been done for birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To carefully interpret the community results we also explored spatio-temporal analyses at the species level. We identified regions of low originality or specialization communities at the national scale and explored the temporal changes through nineteen years. For the first time, we explored potential congruent or mismatched patterns between different functional traits approaches. </p><p>Next, we evaluated the link between these community indices and human pressures via land use. We used land use as our proxy because threats to global freshwater biodiversity are mainly due to industrial and agricultural impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We tested the sensitivity of each of the six indices to human pressures using habitat modification data sets, and used these results to select biodiversity indicators. Finally, we discussed the choice of indicators selected by communication criteria to give a clear message for stakeholders and, especially in our case, for environmental policy makers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Fish database</title><p>We worked with the database of the French National Agency for Water and Aquatic Environments (Onema), which contains records of standardized electrofishing protocols performed between 1990 and 2009 during low-flow periods (May-October). Electrofishing is considered the most effective non-destructive sampling procedure for describing fish assemblage structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Sampling protocols were defined depending on river width and depth. Streams were sampled by wading (mostly two-pass removal), while fractional sampling strategies were undertaken in larger rivers. Since the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive&#x02019;s surveillance monitoring, protocols follow the recommendations of the European Committee for Standardization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To compare inter-annual densities, however, only surveys performed with the same sampling protocol were selected in the whole data set. Fishes were identified to species level, counted and then released. We worked with the 26 species for which trait data were available (around 90% of the total abundance catch) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080968-t001">Table 1</xref>). </p><table-wrap

We used the 2000 update and considered three alternative groupings of seven habitat classes: (i) The CORINE Land Cover (CLC) yields 5 habitat classes: &#x0201c;Forest&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Meadow&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Farming&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Urban&#x0201d;, and a &#x0201c;Mix&#x0201d; (i.e. a Mix between agricultural and urban habitats) (ii) The EUROWATER (a special variant of CLC for freshwater common to the European scale), yields 6 habitat classes with the addition of the &#x0201c;Intensive Urban&#x0201d; habitat class, and (iii) The ONEMA land use classification (a special variant of CLC and EUROWATER for freshwater common to the national scale) yields 7 habitat classes with the addition of the &#x0201c;Intensive Farming&#x0201d; class.

A hierarchical clustering (the unweighted pair-group clustering method using arithmetic averages: UPGMA) of the distance matrix produced a functional dendrogram comprising all the species. For each functional tree and the phylogenetic tree we used the procedure of Pavoine et al.

We computed both the Equal-split index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and the QE-based index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The Equal-split index is more influenced by unique traits (trait states observed in a single species) than rare traits (trait states shared by a few species), whereas the reverse is true for the QE-based index. However, as both indices yielded similar results, we retained the equal-split index only, which is subsequently referred to as Species Originality Index (SOI).

We tested the relevance of this index in fishes. Because ecological habitat classes were missing for several species, we used habitat traits and four abiotic variables: temperature (sum of January to June air temperatures), longitudinal gradient, log of elevation, and slope (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref> for more details). We had to take into account the geographical bias in the data set. This bias was linked to an over-sampling of headwaters.

evaluate their potential application as functional biodiversity indicators. For the first time in fish communities, we examine spatio-temporal patterns of six functional facets of biodiversity relying on two different theoretical approaches: specialization and originality. We identified common conservation priorities but also spatial mismatching in function of the trait considered. Then, we linked them with human land use pressures and we identified the community functional originality index based on niche traits as the most likely to become a functional biodiversity indicator. Its sensitivity to the nature and intensity of human disturbance, considered here by an artificialization gradient, at both regional and national scales, results in a simple message to communicate with policy makers and biodiversity managers.</p><sec id="s4.1"><title>I. Community Indices</title><p>There is a growing consensus that functional diversity based on species traits is a better predictor of ecosystem functioning than species number per se [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Species richness is currently the most used biodiversity index (and indicator) but it is highly scale-dependent, with local increases that are often accompanied by regional or global decreases and increases in between-site similarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Particularly, fish species richness tends to increase from upstream to downstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]; and the upstream part of many French rivers sustain only a few fish species (&#x0003c; 5 fish species, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]). Species richness is thus an inadequate surrogate in the context of ecosystem function unlike community traits approaches, which appear more and more relevant in the literature especially to examine ecosystem integrity [16,22,57]. Community-trait indices take into account the species present in the area considered, species being grouped depending on their ecological or phylogenetic affinity. These indices compute the average value for a trait or character, depending on the frequency of species locally present. So, we did not consider intra-specific variability, which sometimes represents a significant proportion of the variability and complex spatio-temporal dynamic [58,59]. Even though specialization community indices seem to give the same message with presence/absence data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], it is not always the case when a process or a function is measured using functional traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover one of the most interesting points to use common species is based on the assumption that abundance plays an important role in ecosystem functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].</p><p>Community Specialization Index (CSI) is a different approach than Community Originality Index (COI) approaches. If CSI is not clear on the underlying mechanisms explaining the precise ecosystem function, its well-known power comes from its holistic habitat approach. The central focus of CSI is not the species feature but its interaction with the environment by the habitat approach. This statement is closer to the Grinnell niche theory approach than the Hutchinson one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. And thus, in the CSI approach, the crucial point is the relevance of habitat description, not the species traits data set. </p><p>On the other side, with the COI we study the distinctiveness of precise species traits and lineages, and thus we postulated that trait variation among species variation relates to functional differences in the ecosystem, which allows an interpretation in terms of ecosystem function or &#x0201c;services&#x0201d;. The set of traits selected is a crucial step toward this goal, especially if we want the dynamics of the indices to reflect ecosystem function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Here, we worked only with traits having a demonstrated functional role in fish biology. For example, morphological traits such as the mouth position or the length of barbell are linked to the diet and food acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Because our originality index is based on distance metrics we verified that it was not species richness dependant of the initial dataset. The life history traits index and the habitat-linked morphological index are less sensitive (R<sup>2</sup>&#x0003e;80, see S1) than the diet-linked morphological index and the niche index (respectively R<sup>2</sup> = 65 and 68, see S1). Moreover, some community indices could be especially sensitive to one or a few species with extreme values of originality. In this study, it was the case with the European eel, which disproportionately increased the original community indices based on phylogeny and on habitat-linked morphology. This is the main purpose of this index, to weight unique species. However, because the European eel is classified as critically endangered at the national and global scales by the IUCN, these original indices also met in this particular case, the red list species indicator. Moreover, the European eel is a patrimonial species, there is a strong cultural heritage in France associated with this species for their fishing and cooking and thus for their taste, but also for their unique form and shape. For this last one based on the human vision, an originality index based on morphology could be common avenues for all species to be &#x0201c;objectively&#x0201d; quantified on the arguments develop by naturalists trying to preserve the unique forms and shapes that have been emerging on Earth.</p></sec><sec id="s4.2"><title>II. Spatio-temporal patterns</title><p>We found that for the river fish communities, mapping each diversity component separately reveals partially congruent patterns between functional or phylogenetic originality, and specialization. All indices highlight Corsica, and to a lesser extent the Channel watersheds, as hotspots of originality and specialization. In contrast, the Seine watershed presents a less original and specialized fish community. For all the other watersheds, the different functional and phylogenetic COI and CSI are not congruent. For example, diet-linked and habitat-linked morphological COI present completely different patterns. The former highlights a strong originality in all small rivers especially mountainous streams, whereas the latter did not present any strong variation pattern at all, except for Corsica Island. </p><p>These common patterns suggest that species occurring locally may be derived from regional species pools with similar biogeographical and evolutionary histories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Moreover, for a given regional pool, species may respond to environmental gradients in different ways affecting the spatial distribution of the different biodiversity components and generating a spatial mismatch between functional and phylogenetic COI and CSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. These results challenge the use of a single component as a surrogate for the others, and stress the need to first understand the different processes underlying each index and second to adopt a more integrative approach for conservation. One option to deal with the different messages given by the functional properties of communities and the resulting set of measurements is to be able to provide a hierarchy of their meanings depending on the context and perspectives or more reasonable to only use common patterns. </p><p>A temporal effect has been detected for three original community indices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080968-t003">Table 3</xref>). Both morphological and Niche community indices significantly increased over time. This temporal dynamic should result from a global increase of the total species abundance, which has been shown (t= 5,09; p&#x0003c;0.001) and thus, may be the result of a global improvement of the entire river ecosystems. Indeed, global water quality has improved compared to the last century thanks to significant efforts to decrease organic substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Moreover, fish populations in Europe are still in their re-colonizing process since the last glaciations and some species are expected to extend their geographical area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. More precisely, each index is more influenced by the population dynamic of a few species presenting a high original value. The European eel has a very high original value especially for both habitat-linked morphological and niche indices, even though this species is declining (t= -6,53; p&#x0003c;0.001) which implies an important increase by other species in compensation. For the niche-COI, the global increase could be mainly linked with the population expansion of the European perch, northern pike, and minnow. The northern pike is very popular with anglers favoring their introduction and thus, may have a positive impact on the population dynamic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the case of the diet-linked morphological-COI, it could be explained by three increasing species: the three spines stickleback, the common nase, and again the minnow. And in the case of the habitat-linked morphological-COI, the temporal increase could be mainly linked with the increase of two introduced species: the crucian carp and the pumpkinseed sunfish. Introduced species may increase faster than native species due to their rapid spread and their repeated introductions (accidental or deliberate). </p></sec><sec id="s4.3"><title>III. Community Indicators</title><p>If originality and specialization approaches are completely different in their mathematical calculations, they describe complementary components of the functional properties of communities with similar expectations for their roles in ecosystem services. It has been theoretically and experimentally shown that the alteration of biodiversity disrupts ecological functions performed by species assemblages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], and we know that species niche partitioning is fundamental in ecosystems properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Thus the more we are losing specialist or original species, the more we are losing irreplaceable functions in the ecosystem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. </p><p>The theoretical background underlying the link between COI, CSI, and ecosystem functioning is growing in the literature, but it does not yet mean that both types of indices are relevant as functional biodiversity indicators. Community indicators have to be sensitive to anthropogenic pressures and give a clear and simple message to be technically and practically used by the targeted audience. Thus, the interpretation of indicators has to be as simple as possible and some communication qualities have to be accounting for. An indicator that is well recognized by all biodiversity stakeholders is more likely to be used in the future. According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], one of the most important direct drivers of biodiversity loss and ecosystem service changes are land use modifications, including the physical modification of rivers. In this study we build innovative indices for community river fish in order to open the way for a new generation of indicators based on traits or niche linked with ecosystem functions. We compared each of our created community indices with the land use dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080968-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly the CSI present a very high score in urban areas. Fish communities are composed of specialist species in this artificialized habitat, probably because the environmental filter is very strong and species need to be specialists of this disturbed area such as the Black bullhead (<italic>Ameiurus melas</italic>), an invasive species which have a strong SSI. This pattern of urban specialist species in fish seems to be similar to the bird one, with urban specialist species such as pigeons (<italic>Colombia liva</italic>) or house sparrows (<italic>Passer domesticus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>One COI appears particularly relevant to become a functional indicator of river fish communities, the COI based on species niche. This functional COI is sensitive to the different kinds of human disturbances with a simple interpretation: higher disturbance correlates with lower indicator values. Indeed, when we sorted land use on an artificialization gradient from natural to farming to urban areas, we observed a decrease in the niche-COI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080968-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, the three different variations of the CORINE Land cover data set give exactly the same results for the niche-COI, and thus we can be confident in its reproducibility over classification criteria. Finally, we evaluated its sensitivity to spatial scale. Is the pattern observed at the national scale still present at the regional scale? We observed a consistent pattern over the different watersheds, with the exception of the Mediterranean region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080968-g007">Figure 7</xref>), which may be due to the sample size. More interestingly, but not useful as an indicator, it may due to a local scale dependence or an eco-regional dependence. Indeed, Mediterranean watershed is very small and without any big river. In addition, all the urban areas are concentrated along the coast in this part of the Mediterranean eco-region. Further investigations need to be done to confirm the context of the use of this potential bio-indicator.</p><p>Otherwise, Niche-COI as a functional biodiversity indicator encompasses species indicators like the CBD headline indicator &#x0201c;trend of selected species&#x0201d; because they consider a complete ecological group with their functions and their common dynamics. As a result, they carry more significant ecological information so that expectations and objectives for biodiversity stakeholders can be derived. Originality indices have already been used as indicators in biodiversity conservation contexts. Isaac et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] built one called EDGE (Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered) based on the phylogenetic originality and conservation status of species. At the community level, Mouillot et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] have suggested functional and phylogenetic COI to evaluate conservation action areas. Because interspecific competition is more intense among species sharing common traits due to the limiting similarity principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], they expected that under protected areas competition might drive the better colonization or subsistence of the most original species because of niche complementary. We believe that even if one of the goals of this study was to develop functional biodiversity indicators for environmental policy makers, the Niche-COI could also be used at the scale of conservation reserves and may be used by managers of protected areas. </p><p>Finally, we have to keep in mind that biodiversity indicators help to prioritize conservation actions to conserve ecological functions and <italic>in fine</italic> ecosystem &#x0201c;services&#x0201d;. However, evaluation and measure alone are not sufficient in order to stop biodiversity loss, human pressures also must be limited. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0080968.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p><bold>Complementary analysis: Sensitivity of the SOI to the number of species.</bold> Table S1, List of the studied species.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0080968.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0080968.s002"><label>File S2</label><caption><p><bold>Complete sensitivity analysis results of community indices to human pressures.</bold> Table S2, Complete results of the relation between community indices and land used.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0080968.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Marion Strong and Misha Leong for their English review.
