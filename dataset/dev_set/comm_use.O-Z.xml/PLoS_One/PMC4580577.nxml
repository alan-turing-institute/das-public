A series of panel econometric models were used taking the period 1995&#x02013;2011 into consideration. The results indicated that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in China increased over time, and were characterized by noticeable regional discrepancies; in addition, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions also exhibited properties of spatial dependence and convergence. Factors such as population scale, economic level and urbanization level exerted a positive influence on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Conversely, energy intensity was identified as having a negative influence on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In addition, the significance of the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the four variables varied across the provinces based on their scale of economic development. Scenario simulations further showed that the scenario of middle economic growth, middle population increase, low urbanization growth, and high technology improvement (here referred to as Scenario BTU), constitutes the best development model for China to realize the future sustainable development. Based on these empirical findings, we also provide a number of policy recommendations with respect to the future mitigation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71433008 and No. 41501175; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/">http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/</ext-link>) and Non-profit Industry Financial Program of Ministry of Land and Resources of China (Grant No. 201411014-2).

That greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuel, are the main influencing factor of global warming which is now a matter of global consensus and, since CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are closely related to socioeconomic development, climate change has gone from being an issue for pure scientific research to becoming an international political, economic and diplomatic hot topic [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Locating the key influencing factors of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, in order to effectively curb these emissions, is an increasingly important task, especially for China, the world&#x02019;s largest developing country [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Studies show that China&#x02014;as the world&#x02019;s largest energy consumer, consuming nearly half of all coal produced in the year of 2008, and the world&#x02019;s highest CO<sub>2</sub> emitter, accounting for one-quarter of the world&#x02019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the year of 2011 &#x02013;has been responsible for 80% of global increases in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions since 2008 [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is therefore vitally important that an optimal development model be identified which has the capacity to enable China to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions while maintaining economic growth. It is now generally recognised that energy consumption is the key impact factor of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; in order to realise CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduction targets, though, we also need to examine other important influencing factors in relation to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Consequently, the following questions are critical to China&#x02019;s sustainable development: How does the scale of the population, the economic level, energy intensity, and the level of urbanization affect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions? Do CO<sub>2</sub> emissions continue to growth rapidly? Modelling and forecasting China&#x02019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would allow us to determine the optimal development model for future socioeconomic development.</p><p>Studies are increasingly being undertaken in order to examine the factors that affect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in a range of different countries and regions [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The existing literature addressing the influencing factors of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions mainly falls into four categories, which can be differentiated in terms of different methods used in their studies. The first category of studies rely upon the stochastic impact by regression on population, affluence (GDP) and technology (IPAT) model, in its extended form&#x02014;the STIRPAT model. The STIRPAT (IPAT) model is one of the most popular methods for exploring the impact factors of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and it has been used in a large range of studies&#x02014;for instance, in studies undertaken by York et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Shi [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], who adopted the model in order to estimate the influence of population scale on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; in Xu and Chen [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], a study which analysed the impact of population and affluence on emissions in China; in Fan et al.&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] exploration of the influence of population, GDP and technology on the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of countries fallen into different groups based on income levels; and in Liu and Liu&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] study of the determinants of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in China. Similar studies have also been also undertaken by Lin et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>],Yan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Shao et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], Sun et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Li et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Li et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. More recently, using an improved STIRPAT model, Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found that the urbanization, GDP and industry structure all exerted a positive impact on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Beijing city, while tertiary industry proportion, energy intensity and R&#x00026;D output negatively influenced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. These results are supported by a number of Chinese studies&#x02014;for instance those undertaken in relation to Jilin province by Ma et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Guangdong province by Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and in Tianjin city by Zhao and Guo [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The second category comprises of research that has used structural decomposition analysis (SDA) and index decomposition analysis (IDA), mainly the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model based on time series data. This group of studies includes Ang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], Hoekstra and Van [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Wu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], Ma and Stern [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], Elif et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], Song [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], Brizga et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], Gui et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and Xu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Various index decomposition methods, based on decomposition formulations and index numbers, have been employed in this particular body of literature. In these studies, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have generally been decomposed, using the Kaya Identity model, into population scale, economic scale, energy intensity, energy consumption structure, industrial structure and carbon intensity [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Most studies of this character have found energy intensity and the economic level to be the key influencing factors in relation to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, in comparison to which economic structure, industry structure and energy structure have been found to have a lesser impact.</p><p>The third category is constituted by studies that have relied on panel data analysis. Typically, this method has been used to examine the influencing factors of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on panel data. It is recognized that panel data models have many metrics over conventional cross-sectional and time series data models [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Recently, using the method of panel data analysis, Dinda and Coondoo [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and Narayan and Narayan [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] analysed the relationship between economic growth and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], Ozkan and Ozkan [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], Zhu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and Ozcan [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] have also attempted comprehensive analyses of the impact factors of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, finding population and economic level to be the main factors affecting those emissions.</p><p>The fourth category of studies is made up of research using a range of other determinant analysis models. The representative analysis methods in this group include: the input&#x02013;output model [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138666.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the Laspeyres method [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the AWD method [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the GFI method [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the ARDL model [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the LR-MEF (long-run marginal emissions factor) method [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and the Decoupling index formulation [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These methods have provided new insights into the influence mechanisms in relation to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and have broadened our methodological perspectives.</p><p>These existing studies have enriched our understanding of the main human impact factors in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. However, most of the literature has been inclined to analyse influence mechanisms at a cross-country level [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], at a single-city level or at a national level [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138666.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and only a handful of studies have addressed the cross-province level of China. In addition, despite the fact that it is recognized that panel data sets have many metrics over conventional cross-sectional or time series data sets [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138666.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], most models used in simulating China's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been based on country or city level time series or cross-sectional data [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with only a few studies being based on panel data models [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138666.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. More importantly, existing studies have mainly focused on estimating the influencing factors of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, seldom proceeding to analyse the development models that might promote a country&#x02019;s sustainable development.</p><p>Based on the above review, this study first calculated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for China&#x02019;s 30 provinces over the period 1995&#x02013;2011, and then analysing the spatiotemporal characteristics. We proceed to examine the key influencing factors quantitatively using panel data models. Based on the coefficients calculated in this study, and taking China as an example, this paper sets up 10 different scenarios in order to forecast future CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Under a CO<sub>2</sub> emissions constraint force, we attempt to identify the optimal development model for China.</p><p>The remainder of this study is organised as follows. Section 2 focuses on methods and data, presenting the models and the data utilized. Section 3 displays the results of the paper and sets out a discussion of the scenarios through which the optimal development model was selected. Finally, Section 4 summaries the main conclusions and policy implications.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methodology and Data</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Estimating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</title><p>In this study, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are described in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions, a measure which refers to the carbon content of greenhouse gases with the same global warming potential. Currently, in China it is very difficult to acquire provincial data for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions directly. However, because CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are mainly released through fossil fuel combustion and cement production, these two measures prove useful in approximating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through energy-related statistical data. Based on methods developed in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], this paper calculates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the basis of these two aspects (that is, the burning of fossil fuel and the cement production process) for China&#x02019;s 30 provinces from 1995 to 2011. Using the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions coefficients published by the 2006 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and the National Coordination Committee Office on Climate Change and the Energy Research Institute under the National Development and Reform Commission [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel can be calculated through the following formula:

This paper will introduce three types of panel unit root test&#x02014;namely, the Levin-Lin-Chu (LLC) test [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], the Breitung test [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and the Im-Pesaran-Shin (IPS) test [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

As such, a Pedroni cointegration test, first developed by Pedroni [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], was introduced into the study to examine whether a cointegration relationship existed between the indicators. The Pedroni cointegration test allows for intercepts and trends with different individual effects, and this test is used for both balanced and unbalanced panel data. Compared to traditional panel data models, the Pedroni cointegration test includes a number of great improvements. Specifically, the Pedroni test allows for major differences between the slope coefficient, the fixed effect coefficient and the trend coefficient of different individuals.</p><p>Working under a series of assumptions, Pedroni [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] develops two types of residual-based tests. In the first type, four tests are distributed as being standard normal asymptotically and are based on average test statistics for no cointegration in the time series across the cross-section for the within-group [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The tests that make up this group are: panel v-statistics, panel &#x003c1;-statistics, panel t-Statistic (non-parametric) and panel t-Statistic (parametric). Within the second type, three tests&#x02014;group r-statistics, group t-statistics (non-parametric) and the group statistics (parametric)&#x02013;are also distributed as being standard normal asymptotically but are based on limits of piecewise numerator and denominator terms for the limiting distributions for the between-group [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Three of the four tests in the first type of test are based on the non-parametric correction test proposed by Phillips and Perron [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]; the remaining test follows the ADF parametric test.

FMOLS, proposed by Pedroni [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], is a single equation estimator for cointegrated relationships.

The identification of such a scenario will have great significance and meaning for the formulation of future economic development policy and the mitigation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

Provincial data on resident populations, per capita GDP, cement, energy intensity and urbanization levels were derived from the China Statistical Yearbook and provincial statistical yearbooks. To eliminate the price effect, per capita GDP data were adjusted by considering the official price index in the year 2000, which was also used to calculate energy intensity in tons per 10<sup>4</sup> Yuan.

During the study period, Shandong Province was the largest emitter with its emissions rising from 212.55 million tons in 1995 to 705.42 million tons in 2011, while Hainan Province was the smallest emitter with its emissions increasing from 6.81 million tons in 1995 to 32.18 million tons in 2011. The former province produces more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions owing to its huge consumption of fossil energy compared to other regions. Notably, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions form east regions were initially larger and increased more rapidly than their neighbours in central and west regions during the period studied. From the viewpoint of geography, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in China exerted noticeable regional discrepancies in 1995&#x02013;2011 (<xref rid="pone.0138666.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).

However, not all variables have cointegrating relationships. Thus, prior to cointegration estimation, it is necessary to test the stationarity of variables; this is known as a unit root test. In this study, we employed three types of panel unit root test: the Levin-Lin-Chu (LLC) test, the Breitung test and the Im-Pesaran-Shin (IPS) test. The LLC and Breitung methods are both suitable for common root tests, and the IPS method is suitable for individual root tests. <xref rid="pone.0138666.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> reviews the results of the panel unit root test for both types. As indicated by <xref rid="pone.0138666.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>, the results clearly show that all the variables cannot reject the null hypothesis at level, indicating that they were not stationary at level. However, all the variables were found to be stationary at the first difference, rejecting the null hypothesis. As such, we were able to carry out a Pedroni cointegration test in order to estimate whether a cointegrating relationship existed between the variables. If the variables were found to be cointegrated, the Fully Modified OLS estimator would be used to examine the relationship quantitatively.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0138666.t008" orientation="portrait"

we proceeded to test the dependent and independent variables respectively for Pedroni cointegration in the data, using the heterogeneous panel cointegration test first proposed by Pedroni [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. <xref rid="pone.0138666.t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref> presents the panel cointegration test results. To examine the cointegrating relationship more accurately, we employed three trend assumptions from the Pedroni cointegration test, namely: no deterministic trend, deterministic intercept and trend, and no deterministic intercept or trend. From the results detailed in <xref rid="pone.0138666.t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>, we found that under the assumption of no deterministic trend, six statistics strongly rejected the null hypothesis of no-cointegration significantly at the 1% level; while under the assumption of deterministic intercept and trend, seven statistics were found to reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration at less than the 10% level. In addition, under the assumption of no deterministic intercept or trend, six statistics also strongly rejected the null hypothesis of no cointegration significantly at less than the 5% level. Thus we obtained clear evidence of the existence of a cointegrating relationship between the variables. Results also indicate that population scale, economic level, energy intensity and urbanization level had a long-run relationship with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in China&#x02019;s 30 provinces during the study period. The next step was to estimate this relationship using Fully Modified OLS regression.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0138666.t009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0138666.t009</object-id><label>Table 9</label><caption><title>Pedroni cointegration test results.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0138666.t009g" xlink:href="pone.0138666.t009"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trend assumption</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No deterministic trend</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Deterministic intercept &#x00026;

A Fully Modified OLS test was utilised based on provincial panel data. A panel data model with a Newey-West fixed effect was adopted; the Kernel option of the model was based on the Bartlett law. <xref rid="pone.0138666.t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref> reviews the results of the Fully Modified OLS test. Parameter estimations of the panel data model reveal that the individual variable coefficients have important but various influence on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Specifically, population scale, economic level and urbanization level have positive effects on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, while energy intensity produces negative, inhibitory effects. First, as expected, the increase of population directly leads to an increasing demand of energy resources and, in turn, produce a large amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Second, since the Chinese economic reform in 1978, China has witnessed rapid economic growth. However, this rapid growth has been achieved by consuming a large amount of energy resources, leading to a great deal of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Third, millions of people lived in rural areas moved to cities and towns across China every year. This migration creates increasing pressure on the country's urban sustainable development. Urbanization has a promoting effect on economic development, but it can also contribute to the increase of energy consumption. Finally, reducing energy intensity (per capita GDP energy consumption) is conducive to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. That is because improving energy efficiency mean producing the same amount of GDP with mitigated energy use, which will indirectly migitate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, the significance of the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the four variables also varied across the provinces based on their scale of social and economic development. Similar results were found by Al-mulali [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] in the Middle East and Li et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] at regional and national levels in China. From the perspective of geographic analysis (<xref rid="pone.0138666.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), provinces with high coefficients of population and energy intensity were found to be mainly concentrated in northern and central China respectively. However, areas with relative high coefficients of the other two variables (per capita GDP and urbanization) were found to have decentralized distributions. Since this study used a panel data model, we will focus on the panel effect and panel analysis results in this paper. The panel FMOLS test results show that all the four variables&#x02014;population, per capita GDP, energy intensity and urbanization&#x02014;all maintained a positive long-run relationship with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions&#x02014;that is: a 1% increase in total population will increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 1.359500% and a 1% increase in per capita GDP will increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 0.373704%, and, in addition, a 1% increase in energy intensity will increase CO<sub>2</sub> emission by 0.277178%. Finally, a 1% increase in urbanization will increase CO<sub>2</sub> emission by 0.591743%. The results of the study indicate that population, per capita GDP, energy intensity and urbanization are the main human factors that influence CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the long run.

On the basis of the B scenario, if the economic growth rate increases by 1% (Scenario H), China&#x02019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will increase by 0.15, 0.41, and 0.74 billion tons in 2015, 2020, and 2025 respectively. With rapid economic growth, if the population growth rate continues to increase (Scenario HP), China&#x02019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will increase by 0.26, 0.54, and 1.03 billion tons by 2015, 2020, and 2025 respectively, compared to Scenario B. However, if the development and use of low-carbon technologies could be promoted, and economic development simultaneously boosted (Scenario HT), China&#x02019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will decrease by 0.12, 0.28, and 0.42 billion tons by 2015, 2020, and 2025 respectively. If the population continues to increase on the basis of the HT scenario, China&#x02019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will increase by 0.23, 0.41, and 0.77 billion tons, in comparison with Scenario B.</p><p>The findings of this study indicate that in a scenario where the country&#x02019;s economic growth rate decreases by 1% and the process of urbanization concurrently slows (Scenario L), China&#x02019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will decrease by 0.39, 0.65, and 0.97 billion tons by 2015, 2020, and 2025 respectively, in comparison with Scenario B. If the economic growth rate decreases, however, and low-carbon technologies have been promoted (Scenario LT), China&#x02019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will decline by 0.41, 0.77, and 1.20 billion tons by 2015, 2020, 2025 respectively, compared to Scenario B. At the same time, of all the scenarios explored in this study, we find China to have the lowest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions under Scenario LT. If the country&#x02019;s population continues to increase on the basis of Scenario LT, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will increase accordingly. If the economy has a middle level of growth, urbanization is relatively low, low-carbon technologies rapidly improve, and population growth occurs at a middle level (Scenario BTU), China&#x02019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will decrease by 0.27, 0.38, and 0.52 billion tons by 2015, 2020, and 2025 respectively, compared to Scenario B. However, if the population has a high growth rate, as in Scenario BH, China&#x02019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will increase accordingly by 0.34, 038, 0.54 billion tons by 2015, 2020, and 2025 (compared to Scenario BTU).</p><p>The above analysis indicates that China would have the lowest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions under Scenario LT. However, Scenario LT requires that the economy maintain a relatively low level of growth, that population growth maintain a middle level, that urbanization increase at a low level, and that low-carbon technologies be promoted widely. The rapid development model currently pursued by China does not conform to these conditions. As the world&#x02019;s largest CO<sub>2</sub> emitter, China faces the dual challenge of mitigating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions while concurrently maintaining economic growth. Therefore, among the 10 scenarios, only the Scenario BTU conforms to the aim of maintaining a middle level of economic growth and effectively reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p>It is essential to compare the results of our estimations of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions with other recent studies. <xref rid="pone.0138666.t011" ref-type="table">Table 11</xref> reviews the results of estimations made by Chen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], IEA [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], Cai et al.

[<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and this study. The estimated emissions detailed in this study are higher than that of IEA [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], Cai et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and EIA [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], but are close to that of Du et al. [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is notable that two sources were considered in estimating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in this study: the combustion of fossil fuel and the cement production process. It is noted that the studies identified above only consider fossil fuel related emissions. Du et al.

A growing question lies in the optimal development model for China&#x02014;which model would allow China to face the challenge of mitigating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions while concurrently maintaining economic growth? In addressing this question, this paper investigated the spatiotemporal variations, influencing factors and scenario simulations of China&#x02019;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, based on a provincial panel data set covering the period of 1995 to 2011. To examine the influencing factors of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions quantitatively, a CO<sub>2</sub> emissions model was developed considering CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as the dependent variable and population, per capita GDP, energy intensity and the urbanization level as the independent variables. Panel unit root tests, a panel cointegration test, and FMOLS estimator were all utilised. Building on the estimated relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the four independent variables studied, and taking China as an example, this paper created 10 different scenarios to forecast future CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Under a CO<sub>2</sub> emissions constraint force, we attempted to find the optimal development model for China.</p><p>There were significant differences of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions among China&#x02019;s provinces. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of all provinces have increased over the studied period and the emissions varied across the provinces. In addition, evidence of spatial dependence was identified in provincial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and the fluctuations of Moran&#x02019;s I may have important role in the agglomeration of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over time. A graphical analysis of the initial level and average annual growth rate of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions suggested a convergence existing in provincial China.</p><p>Parameter estimations of the panel data model revealed that population scale, economic level and urbanization level positively influenced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, while energy intensity exerted negative, inhibitory effects. In addition, the significance of the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the four variables varied across the provinces based on their scale of social and economic development. From the perspective of panel data analysis, and focusing on panel effect, a quantitative relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the four independent variables was identified: a 1% increase in population, per capita GDP, energy intensity and urbanization was found to result in an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 1.359500%, 0.373704%, 0.277178%, and 0.591743% respectively.</p><p>To achieve the goal of curbing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions while maintaining economic growth, this paper reviewed 10 different developing scenarios. The study forecasted future CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on the relationship obtained from the panel data analysis. Under a CO<sub>2</sub> emissions constraint force, scenario simulations further showed that Scenario BTU&#x02014;that is, middle economic growth, middle population increase, low urbanization growth, and high technology improvement&#x02014;would provide the best development model for China to realise socioeconomic sustainable development and a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p>The above findings thus contribute to the literature and suggest meaningful theoretical and policy implications [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. First, from the evidence provided by the results of this study, population scale and urbanization are important factors that increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Since the Chinese economic reform in 1978, China has entered a period of rapid urbanization. Results suggest that China should continue to carry out the family planning policy, which has aimed to slow the robust growth of the country&#x02019;s vast population and maintain healthy levels of population urbanization&#x02013; according to official data, this policy has helped Asia&#x02019;s biggest economy reduce its population by millions. In addition, China should also continue to promote stable and relative low population urbanization and pay attention to optimizing population structure and quality. More importantly, it is essential for China to make greater efforts to improve low-carbon awareness, advocating for low-carbon consumption and healthy lifestyles and promoting sustainable consumption modes to households. Second, the results of this study clearly indicate that economic level positively influences CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Over the past thirty years, China has made great success in economic development, with an annual growth rate of 9.9%. Rapid economic growth can improve living standards, but it can also cause high levels of energy consumption, leading to high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Rapid economic growth, however, retains a high strategic importance for the Chinese government. The government therefore aims to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, while still fostering economic growth. The most feasible method to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the Chinese government is not, as such, to sacrifice future economic growth; rather, slowing economic growth relatively constitutes the most effective measure. Third, China pledged to reduce its energy intensity by 20% on average across all provinces by 2010. In the future, China should continue to target cuts in energy intensity. First, emissions reduction indicators, such as energy and emission intensity, should be set relative to physical output rather in terms of economic growth [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, it is also important to take various measures such as producing more renewable technologies and low-carbon technologies, boosting recycling and renewable energies, and implementing incentive policies, amongst other measures, in order to strengthen energy conservation and emission mitigation [<xref rid="pone.0138666.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>From the view of methodology, this paper underscores the promising aspects of utilizing panel data models such as panel unit root models, panel cointegration tests, and the Fully Modified OLS in understanding the main determinants of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The results of the panel data models are capable of better revealing the factors hidden in the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Chinese provinces over the period studied. Our empirical analysis of Chinese provinces also demonstrates the appropriateness of setting up different scenario simulations for analyzing the optimal development model for China by addressing the influencing variables&#x02019; dynamic evolution changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138666.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Raw Data</title><p>.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138666.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Many thanks to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0138666.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>HT</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>. <article-title>Spatial differences and multi-mechanism of carbon footprint based on GWR model in provincial China</article-title>. <source>Journal of Geographical Sciences</source>
