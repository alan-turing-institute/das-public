<article-title>Genetic Mismatches Between Nuclei and Mitochondria Make Yeast Hybrids Sterile</article-title>
</related-article><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Incompatibility between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in yeast species may represent a general mechanism of reproductive isolation during yeast evolution.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Nuclear-mitochondrial conflict (cytonuclear incompatibility) is a specific form of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility previously shown to cause reproductive isolation in two yeast species. Here, we identified two new incompatible genes, <italic>MRS1</italic> and <italic>AIM22</italic>, through a systematic study of F2 hybrid sterility caused by cytonuclear incompatibility in three closely related <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, and <italic>S. bayanus</italic>). Mrs1 is a nuclear gene product required for splicing specific introns in the mitochondrial <italic>COX1</italic>, and Aim22 is a ligase encoded in the nucleus that is required for mitochondrial protein lipoylation. By comparing different species, our result suggests that the functional changes in <italic>MRS1</italic> are a result of coevolution with changes in the <italic>COX1</italic> introns. Further molecular analyses demonstrate that three nonsynonymous mutations are responsible for the functional differences of Mrs1 between these species. Functional complementation assays to determine when these incompatible genes altered their functions show a strong correlation between the sequence-based phylogeny and the evolution of cytonuclear incompatibility. Our results suggest that nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibility may represent a general mechanism of reproductive isolation during yeast evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Hybrids between species are usually inviable or sterile, possibly due to functional incompatibility between genes from the different species. Incompatible genes are hypothesized to encode interacting components that cannot function properly when paired with alleles from another species. To understand how incompatible gene pairs result in hybrid sterility or inviability, it is important to identify these genes and reconstruct their evolutionary history. A previous study has shown that incompatibility between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (cytonuclear incompatibility) causes hybrid sterility between two yeast species. To expand on these findings, we screened three yeast species for genes involved in cytonuclear incompatibility, discovering two nuclear genes, <italic>MRS1</italic> and <italic>AIM22</italic>, which encode proteins that are unable to support full mitochondrial function in the hybrids. Of these two genes, Mrs1 is required for removing a specific intron in the mitochondrial <italic>COX1</italic> gene. By comparing different yeast species, we find a clear coevolutionary relationship between Mrs1 function and the <italic>COX1</italic> intron pattern. We also show that changes in three amino acids in the Mrs1 RNA-binding domain are sufficient to make Mrs1 incompatible in hybrids. Our results suggest that cytonuclear incompatibility may represent a general mechanism of reproductive isolation during yeast evolution.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reproductive isolation preventing gene flow between diverging populations is crucial for the process of speciation <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Coyne1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. One of the general reproductive isolation mechanisms that lead to hybrid inviability or sterility is genetic incompatibility (Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility), which is caused by improper interactions between genetic loci that have functionally diverged in two different species <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Dobzhansky1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Since genetic incompatibility probably plays an important role at the incipient stage of speciation, identifying the incompatible loci and determining the selection forces underlying their functional divergence are vital for our understanding of how speciation occurs.</p><p>In the past two decades, scientists have discovered several genetic loci causing hybrid sterility or inviability <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Noor1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Genes involved in genetic incompatibility have been cloned from a variety of organisms, including flies, platyfishes, mice, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Mallet1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Presgraves1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Bikard1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Schartl1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Bomblies1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Mihola1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Nonetheless, most of the genes identified were from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and in most cases, only one component of the incompatible genetic loci was cloned. Systematic studies that involve more than two species in other organisms are still rare. Baker's yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and its close relatives, the <italic>Saccharomyces sensu stricto</italic> yeasts, represent an interesting system for studying genetic incompatibility. These yeasts can mate with each other freely under laboratory conditions. Diploid hybrids collected from the wild or generated in the laboratory can reproduce asexually without showing any obvious defect. However, the viability of hybrid gametes (spores) is very low (about 0.5&#x00025;&#x02013;1&#x00025;), suggesting that there is strong postzygotic reproductive isolation between these yeast species <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Greig1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Because yeast differs from flies in cellular complexity, life style, and population structure, studies in yeast will greatly expand our knowledge of speciation processes <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Greig2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Using chromosome replacement lines of hybrids of two yeast species, a previous study identified a strong incompatibility between a <italic>S. bayanus</italic> nuclear gene, <italic>AEP2</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria that leads to interspecific F2 hybrid sterility <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It was found that the 5&#x02032;-UTR regions of a mitochondrion gene, <italic>OLI1</italic>, have diverged dramatically between these two species. Since interactions between the Aep2 protein and the 5&#x02032;-UTR region of the <italic>OLI1</italic> mRNA are essential for <italic>OLI1</italic> translation, the incompatibility is probably caused by the failure of Sb-Aep2 to recognize the divergent 5&#x02032;-UTR region of <italic>Sc-OLI1</italic>. The finding raises a few interesting questions: Does the cytonuclear incompatibility play a general role in yeast reproductive isolation, does the <italic>AEP2-OLI1</italic> type of interaction (activation of mRNA translation) represent a common mode of cytonuclear incompatibility, and is there a specific selective force driving this type of cytonuclear evolution?</p><p>The mitochondrion is a critical component of cellular energy production and several metabolic pathways. In many organisms including yeast, proper mitochondrial functions are required for gamete development <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Yamagata1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Fishman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Hanson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The mitochondrion contains its own genome, though one in an advanced state of degeneration. Most genes essential for mitochondrial functions have been transferred from the proto-mitochondrion genome to that of their host <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. As a consequence of these events, gene products from both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes are required for proper mitochondrial operations <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Dieckmann1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Grivell1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In yeast, for example, the mitochondrial genome encodes only eight proteins, but it is estimated that &#x0223c;1,000 proteins function in mitochondria <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Reinders1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Although these two genomes are under different mutation and selection pressures, they are constrained to evolve coordinately to maintain optimal functions <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Rand1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>; any change in mitochondria (adaptive or drifted) may require one or more consecutive changes in the nucleus <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Rand1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Blier1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This type of interaction provides an ideal background for the evolution of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities; when two populations containing well-adapted cytonuclear mutations mix their genomes, unmatched mitochondria and nuclei cause reduced hybrid fitness <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Gershoni1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Cytonuclear incompatibility has been observed in a wide range of organisms, including primates, amphibians, flies, wasps, a marine copepod, and a variety of plants <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Barrientos1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Chase1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Ellison1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Ellison2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Liepins1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Sackton1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In yeast, cytonuclear incompatibility has been tested directly by transferring mitochondria from one species or strain into cells of another, which clearly showed a species barrier between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Spirek1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Sulo1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. From these studies, we know that the deleterious effects of cytonuclear incompatibility can lead to reduced fitness, hybrid sterility, or inviability. Nonetheless, molecular descriptions of such an intracellular conflict are rare, and its generality as an engine of speciation remains an open question.</p><p>Here, we present results of a systematic study aimed at understanding the role of cytonuclear incompatibility in postzygotic reproductive isolation. We screened three <italic>sensu stricto</italic> yeasts, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, and <italic>S. bayanus</italic> for incompatible genes causing F2 hybrid sterility and used the information about how these genes diverged in function to reconstitute the evolutionary history of the species. We found that only a few strongly incompatible gene pairs have evolved between these species. Two of them, <italic>MRS1</italic> and <italic>AIM22</italic>, were identified and the molecular mechanisms of incompatibility were characterized. By analyzing the mutations of the <italic>MRS1</italic> gene leading to its functional divergence between two species at the nucleotide level, we show that only three mutations make major contributions. Finally, we show that the functional divergence of these incompatible genes is correlated with the phylogeny, suggesting that cytonuclear incompatibility not only represents a general mechanism of reproductive isolation but has also occurred repeatedly during yeast evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cytonuclear Incompatibility between Three <italic>Saccharomyces sensu stricto</italic> Yeasts</title><p>A previous study has shown that incompatibility between a <italic>S. bayanus</italic> nuclear gene, <italic>AEP2</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria causes interspecific F2 hybrid sterility <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. To examine whether nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibility represents a general mechanism of reproductive isolation in yeast, a systematic screen for such genes was conducted in three closely related yeast species: <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Sc), <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (Sp), and <italic>S. bayanus</italic> (Sb). Hybrid diploid strains between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, or between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. bayanus</italic> were induced to generate haploid spores containing different combinations of chromosomes from their parental species. These spores were then assayed for cytonuclear incompatibility. In hybrid diploids between species A and B, incompatibility could occur in two directions, between A-nucleus and B-mitochondria or between B-nucleus and A-mitochondria. When generating the yeast hybrids, we deliberately removed one parental type of mitochondria (by using <italic>&#x003c1;</italic>
<sup>0</sup> mutants, which lack mitochondrial DNA) so that we could unambiguously assign the direction of incompatibility. After sporulation of hybrids, viable spores were measured for their ability to grow on glycerol, a non-fermentable carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000432-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The results showed strong cytonuclear incompatibility in most of the interspecific hybrids; we observed 66&#x00025;&#x000b1;5&#x00025;, 78&#x00025;&#x000b1;7&#x00025;, and 32&#x00025;&#x000b1;16&#x00025; of respiration-proficient spores in the interspecific crosses between Sc-<italic>&#x003c1;</italic>

Our results, on the other hand, suggest that nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibility is also a promising candidate for causing intrinsic hybrid dysfunction. In fact, these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Genomes from different populations will accumulate enough DNA sequence divergence only after extended periods of allopatric isolation, but the effect of sequence divergence can be applied directly in the diploid F1 hybrid cells. Cytonuclear incompatibility can be achieved by only a few mutations, and its deleterious effect can be carried on to the F1 gamete or F2 progeny. In theory, cytonuclear incompatibility has a stronger impact on blocking gene flow between populations in the early stages of speciation, and reproductive isolation is reinforced later on when populations have accumulated enough DNA sequence divergence. These two mechanisms can be complementary to each other in terms of their effects and evolutionary trajectories. It will be interesting to investigate whether cytonuclear incompatibility exists between different populations of the same species.</p><p>Reproductive isolation resulting from genetic incompatibility has been discovered in a variety of organisms <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Presgraves1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Most of the examples characterized so far are caused by interactions between nuclear genes.

Cytonuclear incompatibility probably represents a more general mechanism of reproductive isolation in yeast. By analyzing the functions and the interacting components of the identified incompatible genes, we discovered that cytonuclear incompatibility could be achieved by multiple molecular mechanisms: intron splicing, protein lipoylation, and activation of mRNA translation. This suggests that cytonuclear incompatibility in yeast can occur in various pathways by diverse molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Scientists usually compare orthologous sequences from different species and use the detected molecular signatures to infer the evolutionary process of a gene. Since our data suggest that Mrs1 changed function only after <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> diverged from <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, it is reasonable to assume that the altered function originated from amino acid changes that occurred specifically in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lineage.

Interestingly, our functional assays showed that only three of these amino acid changes contribute significantly to the functional differences of Mrs1. The other mutations may have very minor effects unable to be detected by our functional assays or have been fixed simply by genetic drift.

<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Rawson1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. These results illustrate the importance of mapping the critical amino acid changes in order to understand how a gene evolved.</p><p>What is the major driving force underlying the evolution of mitochondria? It is known that the mitochondrial genome suffers a higher mutation load because it is constantly facing higher levels of oxidative reagents and its DNA protection system is more primitive as compared to the nuclear genome. With a much smaller copy number of mitochondrial DNA in yeast (30&#x02013;80 molecules of mitochondrial genomes in yeast cells compared to 1,000&#x02013;5,000 molecules in animal cells), mutations may be fixed frequently in the mitochondrial genome by genetic drift. Since wild yeast often propagate clonally in natural environments <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Greig2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, a founder cell with mild deleterious mutations in its mitochondrial genome may have a chance to accumulate suppressors in the mitochondrial or nuclear genomes to rescue the fitness before its progeny are outcompeted by cells from another population. Alternatively, mitochondrial evolution may be driven by an &#x0201c;arms race&#x0201d; process between selfish mitochondrial DNA and the &#x0201c;wild-type&#x0201d; mitochondrial or nuclear genomes. It is commonly observed in yeast that by manipulating the host replication or segregation systems, some mitochondrial genomes allow themselves to be inherited more efficiently, even though they may be carrying compromised respiratory functions <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Contamine1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In a sexual population, the other mitochondrial or host nuclear genomes will be selected to counteract this selfish behavior or the deleterious effects carried by the selfish DNA. Such an &#x0201c;arms race&#x0201d; may allow mitochondrial genomes to evolve faster than by genetic drift (in a fashion similar to positive selection). Incompatibilities driven by arms races between different genetic components have been suggested in a few recent studies <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Presgraves1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Among these genetic conflicts, most of them are caused by selfish elements manipulating segregation distortion <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Mihola1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Ferree1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Phadnis1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Bayes1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.

The genetic conflict caused by selfish mitochondrial genomes may represent another type of arms race. It will be interesting to investigate whether the arms race model can explain the cytonuclear incompatibilities observed in other organisms. Finally, ecological adaptation may also contribute to mitochondrial evolution.

It has been suggested that cytonuclear incompatibility caused by different trajectories of mitochondrial evolution in different species may contribute to this phenomenon <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Turelli1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Bolnick2" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Our results provide the molecular basis to support this hypothesis. Since cytonuclear incompatibility can be achieved by multiple molecular mechanisms and evolve at different rates in different lineages, it can serve as a general mechanism of reproductive isolation and also create asymmetrical reproductive isolation between species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains and Genetic Procedures</title><p>Yeast strain genotypes are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000432.s006">Table S2</xref>.

Strains from the first species also had a <italic>URA3</italic> marker inserted near the centromere of a chromosome so that haploid spores could be efficiently selected on 5-FOA plates. After the hybrid diploids were induced to sporulate, viable spores were tested for their respiratory ability. Respiration-deficient clones were further crossed with <italic>&#x003c1;</italic>
<sup>0</sup> mutants of the parental species to confirm that the defect was caused by cytonuclear genomic incompatibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000432-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A genetic analysis was used to estimate the number of the nuclear genes that are incompatible with mitochondrial DNA from another species: in a cross between two <italic>spo11&#x00394;</italic> mutants, meiotic recombination does not occur and homologous chromosomes segregate randomly <xref rid="pbio.1000432-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1000432-Shonn1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. For a specific chromosome A, 25&#x00025; of the spores will carry two A chromosomes (of both parental types), 50&#x00025; of them will carry one A chromosome, and 25&#x00025; of them will have no A chromosome (these cells will not survive so they will not be counted in our later analysis). If only one gene on chromosome A is recessively incompatible with mitochondrial DNA (in our case, all spores from a single cross carry the same parental type of mitochondrial DNA), we expect to see that 66&#x00025; of the viable spores are Gly&#x0002b; (1/3&#x0002b;2/3&#x000d7;1/2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;66&#x00025;). The spores carrying two A chromosomes should be Gly&#x0002b; because the incompatibility is recessive. Half of the spores that carry only one A chromosome should be Gly&#x0002b; if their A chromosome is from the same parent of the mitochondrial DNA. If two genes on different chromosomes are involved, we expect to see that 43&#x00025; of the viable spores are Gly&#x0002b; (66&#x00025;&#x000d7;66&#x00025;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;43&#x00025;).
