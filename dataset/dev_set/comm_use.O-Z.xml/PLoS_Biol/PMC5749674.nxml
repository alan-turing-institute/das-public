Such maps provide important starting points for neuron classification, for functional analysis, and for developmental studies aimed at defining the molecular mechanisms of neuron identity acquisition and neuron identity diversification. In this resource paper, we describe a nervous system-wide map of the potential expression sites of 244 members of the largest gene family in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genome, rhodopsin-like (class A) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) chemoreceptors, using classic <italic>gfp</italic> reporter gene technology. We cover representatives of all sequence families of chemoreceptor GPCRs, some of which were previously entirely uncharacterized. Most reporters are expressed in a very restricted number of cells, often just in single cells. We assign GPCR reporter expression to all but two of the 37 sensory neuron classes of the sex-shared, core nervous system. Some sensory neurons express a very small number of receptors, while others, particularly nociceptive neurons, coexpress several dozen GPCR reporter genes. GPCR reporters are also expressed in a wide range of inter- and motorneurons, as well as non-neuronal cells, suggesting that GPCRs may constitute receptors not just for environmental signals, but also for internal cues. We observe only one notable, frequent association of coexpression patterns, namely in one nociceptive amphid (ASH) and two nociceptive phasmid sensory neurons (PHA, PHB). We identified GPCRs with sexually dimorphic expression and several GPCR reporters that are expressed in a left/right asymmetric manner. We identified a substantial degree of GPCR expression plasticity; particularly in the context of the environmentally-induced dauer diapause stage when one third of all tested GPCRs alter the cellular specificity of their expression within and outside the nervous system. Intriguingly, in a number of cases, the dauer-specific alterations of GPCR reporter expression in specific neuron classes are maintained during postdauer life and in some case new patterns are induced post-dauer, demonstrating that GPCR gene expression may serve as traits of life history. Taken together, our resource provides an entry point for functional studies and also offers a host of molecular markers for studying molecular patterning and plasticity of the nervous system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Maps of gene expression patterns in nervous systems provide an important resource for neuron classification, for functional analysis, and for developmental studies that ask how different neurons acquire their unique identities. By analyzing transgenic GFP reporter strains, we describe here the expression pattern of 244 putative chemosensory receptor-encoding genes, which constitute the largest gene family in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. As expected, chemoreceptor expression is enriched in chemosensory neurons. Putative chemoreceptors are also expressed in a wide range of interneurons and motor neurons, as well as non-neuronal cells, suggesting that these receptors may sense internal cues in addition to environmental signals. Each chemoreceptor is expressed sparsely, often in just one neuron type, but each neuron type can express many chemoreceptors. Chemoreceptor expression is remarkably plastic, particularly in the context of the environmentally induced dauer diapause stage. Taken together, this molecular atlas of chemosensory receptors provides an entry point for functional studies and offers a host of markers for studying neuronal patterning and plasticity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>NIH (grant number 1F31NS096863) to EAB.

Molecular markers that are constitutively and invariably expressed throughout the life of a specific neuron type provide static views of neuronal identity and hence provide entry points to study how invariable identity features are acquired during neuronal differentiation [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In contrast, some molecular features of a neuron display a remarkable plasticity in that their expression may be regulated by neuronal activity or in response to specific environmental cues. Such genes serve as markers to understand the nature of the gene regulatory programs that govern such dynamic features of a neuron. We reasoned that a significant expansion of the expression analysis of chemosensory G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), initiated more than 20 years ago [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] using <italic>gfp</italic>-based reporter gene technology [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], may yield a significantly expanded resource of molecular markers that may label various aspects of neuronal identity and neuronal plasticity in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> nervous system.</p><p>Animal genomes encode five major classes of GPCRs, of which the rhodopsin class (or &#x0201c;class A&#x0201d;) is the largest class [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t001">Table 1</xref>). Rhodopsin class GPCRs can be subdivided into phylogenetically deeply conserved neurotransmitter receptors (neuropeptides, acetylcholine, biogenic amines) as well as non-conserved, chemosensory-type GPCRs (csGPCRs) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t001">Table 1</xref>). The csGPCRs have independently expanded in distinct animal phyla where they serve to respond to diverse, physiologically relevant external and, supposedly, internal cues [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

The majority of these 76 reporters revealed expression in chemosensory neurons [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

The expression of csGPCRs in interneurons also prompted efforts to identify the function of some of these genes.

(2) The expression of several csGPCRs revealed a remarkable plasticity in response to changes in the environment.

Our explicit goal in this analysis was to (1) generate more neuronal identity markers, (2) test the hypothesis that many more sensory neurons may be lateralized, (3) identify more markers of neuronal plasticity, (4) identify more markers of sexual dimorphism, and (5) examine the extent of expression in non-sensory and non-neuronal cells (suggesting roles as receivers of internal signals). Based on the molecular classification of csGPCRs into defined families, we were also interested in determining whether the expression of specific subfamilies&#x02014;particularly those whose expression has not previously been examined&#x02014;may reveal specific common themes (i.e., patterns of coexpression or expression in specific cells) that may provide a hint to their function. We synthesize our findings with those of previous expression pattern analyses to carve out a number of general features of csGPCR expression patterns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Mutant strains</title><p>Strains were maintained by standard methods [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

The obvious shortcoming of this technology is that reporter genes may not capture the full <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory content of the respective GPCR-encoding locus, but as we will describe in more detail below, most GPCR-encoding loci are compact with small intergenic regions and introns. We emphasize that our approach is not necessarily aimed at identifying the complete set of cells expressing a GPCR, but, following ample precedent, is rather aimed at identifying novel and informative patterns of expression, as incomplete as these patterns may be.</p><p>We utilized two sources of csGPCR reporters. A consortium at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver) has generated a valuable, large panel of reporters for 1886 genes in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genome [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, the site of expression of these reporters has not been determined with single cell resolution in the nervous system.

We adhered to the following principles in the choice of genes and design of reporters: first, we aimed to cover all 23 classes of chemoreceptor genes defined by Thomas and Robertson [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t002">Table 2</xref>). Using phylogenetic trees assembled by Thomas and Robertson, we sampled each gene family evenly, generally avoiding the examination of close sequence paralogues, which we anticipated to reveal similar expression patterns.</p><p>Our own reporters mostly contain all 5&#x02019; intergenic regions fused to <italic>gfp</italic> and contain, at most, 4 kb of sequence. The rationale behind this choice lies in the overall organization of GPCR loci (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004218.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Eighty-nine percent of the approximately 1,300 csGPCR loci contain 5&#x02019; intergenic regions of less than 4 kb. We chose all of our samples from this pool, and, hence, all the reporters generated by us capture the full intergenic region. The reporters from the Vancouver consortium contain about 3 kb of 5&#x02019; intergenic region, at most [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Furthermore, csGPCR loci tend to have small introns (average size 432 base pairs; almost half of them &#x0003c;200 base pairs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004218.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), indicating that relatively little <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory information resides in these introns, which provided the basis for our focus on intergenic regions. For some genes with very short upstream intergenic regions (less than 500 bp) we included the first intron (if this was 300 base pairs or larger) in order to increase the regulatory space contained in the reporters. The coordinates for all reporter constructs can be found in the Supplementary Material.</p><p>Sites of expression within the nervous system were determined mainly for those reporters with the most robust expression patterns and was based on stereotyped cell position, cellular and process morphology, and co-labeling with either DiD (which labels a subset of sensory neurons) or by crossing with landmark strains in which specific neuron classes are labeled with a red fluorescent protein (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Material and methods</xref>). All cell identification was initially done in young adult hermaphrodite animals. As we will describe in detail later, a number of these reporter strains were also subjected to analysis at different stages, under different conditions, and in the two different sexes.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>GPCRs are expressed in restricted patterns within and outside the nervous system</title><p>In our ensuing description of expression patterns of reporter genes, we summarize the expression observed with the previously described reporters, as well as the additional reporters analyzed by us. All of our expression analysis is summarized in a tabular form in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004218.s002">S1 Table</xref>. Three overall features of the 375 csGPCR reporters are immediately apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g001">Fig 1</xref>): first, 92% of analyzed reporters are expressed in the nervous system; second, expression is not restricted to the nervous system: 33% of the reporters are expressed both within and outside the nervous system and 8% are expressed exclusively in non-neuronal cells; and third, the vast majority of csGPCR reporters are expressed in very restricted numbers of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Of the neuronally-expressed reporters, 24% are expressed in single neuron pairs, 27% in 2 neuron pairs, 26% in 3&#x02013;4 neuron pairs, 19% in 5&#x02013;10 neuron pairs, and the remaining 4% in more than 10 neuron pairs.</p><fig id="pbio.2004218.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.2004218.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Summary of csGPCR reporter expression patterns.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Overall tissue distribution of reporter expression patterns in hermaphrodites.

Within the nervous system, expression is most prominent in sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). 84% of the reporters are expressed in amphid sensory neurons (which are made up of 12 pairs of neurons), 20% in phasmid sensory neurons (made up of 2 pairs of neurons, PHA and PHB), and 17% in other sensory neurons. We find that every sensory neuron, except for URY and ADE neurons, expresses at least 1 GPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g001">Fig 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004218.s003">S2 Table</xref>). The number of GPCRs expressed in a given neuron class shows a striking range. The ASI neuron class expresses an impressive 99 GPCR reporters. After ASI, the nociceptive neurons ADL and ASH together with the phasmid neurons PHA and PHB are the sensory neuron classes with higher numbers of GPCRs, expressing 72, 51, 51, and 49 reporters, respectively. Outside the amphid and phasmid neurons, the number of reporters expressed in sensory neurons dramatically drops, with all other sensory neurons expressing less than 10 GPCRs, in some cases only a single GPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g001">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004218.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Of course, it needs to be kept in mind that we only consider expression of a fraction of the csGPCR loci, and hence each of these total numbers is expected to increase by several fold once all csGPCR expression patterns are identified.</p><p>Twenty-four percent of the GPCR reporters for which we have information about neuron numbers are exclusively expressed in a single neuron class, and in all these cases the neuron class is a sensory neuron class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g002">Fig 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004218.s004">S3 Table</xref>). In total, however, only 9 sensory neuron classes express single-neuron-specific GPCRs. The most striking one of them is the ADL nociceptive neuron class, which expresses 23 single-neuron&#x02013;specific GPCR reporters (and an additional 49 GPCR reporters expressed in additional neurons). The ADL-expressed, single-neuron&#x02013;specific GPCRs do not fall into a specific GPCR subfamily but rather cover 7 distinct families. A small subset of the single neuron type-specific GPCRs are expressed outside the nervous system as well (genes with asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

There is no unifying feature of the inter- or motorneurons that express GPCR reporters. They range from ventral cord motor neurons to head interneurons, and to command interneurons in the ventral cord. One interneuron, PVT, displays a very large number of expressed csGPCR reporters (57 different reporters); however, PVT expression is generally observed in an unusually large amount of reporter genes and may, like posterior gut expression, be a reporter gene artifact that relies on cryptic regulatory elements in the reporter gene construct.</p><fig id="pbio.2004218.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.2004218.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>csGPCR reporters expressed in non-amphid/non-phasmid sensory neurons, interneurons, and motorneurons.</title><p>Examples of GPCR reporters expressed in sensory neurons that are not amphids or phasmids (white font), interneurons (orange font), or motorneurons (blue font).

In light of the inter-/motorneuron expression of csGPCR reporters, we can hypothesize that csGPCR reporters that are expressed in sensory neurons may actually not function as receptors for external sensory cues, but may rather function as they likely do in inter-/motorneurons, i.e., as receptors of internal signals.</p><p>We asked whether csGPCR expression profiles cluster by neuron class. To this end, we undertook unsupervised hierarchical clustering of expression profiles. The BP value for most associations was very weak with two exceptions: csGPCR reporters are often coexpressed in the two tail phasmid neuron classes PHA and PHB (AU/BP &#x0003e; 95), and expression in either or both of the phasmid neurons is associated with the expression in the head neuron ASH (AU/BP &#x0003e; 95) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The ASH, PHA and PHB neuron classes are not closely related by lineage but all of these three neuron classes are nociceptive neurons that respond to similar cues and integrate sensory inputs from the head and tail [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and that directly innervate command interneurons involved in reversal behavior [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

Initially again focusing on reporters that are expressed in a restricted number of neurons under well-fed conditions, we found that 16 out of 46 examined reporters show a diverse set of changes in animals that were sent into the dauer stage via a standard starvation/crowding protocol (see Experimental Procedures). Many of the changes entail striking changes in the cellular specificity of GPCR reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g010">Fig 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t005">Table 5</xref>). The vast majority of differences are observed in the nervous system, but some changes also occur outside the nervous system. Changes in GPCR reporter expression in the dauer stage have previously been described for two GPCR reporters [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (summarized with our novel patterns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t005">Table 5</xref>), but the patterns we observe here are much broader and more complex. They can be summarized as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>In most cases, there is stable and unchanged expression in several neuron classes in dauer and non-dauers, but upon dauer entry, expression is either turned on in additional neuron classes (&#x0201c;type I&#x0201d; regulation) or becomes undetectable in subsets of specific neuron classes (&#x0201c;type II&#x0201d; regulation) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t005">Table 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g010">Fig 10</xref>). There are also combinations of both changes (type III regulation): in one particularly striking example, the <italic>srh-71</italic> reporter is expressed in some sensory neurons in both dauer and non-dauers, but undergoes a striking respecification in dauers. Reporter expression becomes undetectable in the lateral IL2, PHA, and an additional pair of tail neurons in dauer, and instead is turned on in the AIZ and ASG neurons (and increases expression levels in ASI). This hints toward the rerouting of internal sensory information.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In a number of cases, reporter expression is strongly down-regulated, becoming undetectable in all neurons in which the reporter is expressed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t005">Table 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The changes outside the nervous system concern three tissue types: muscle, the excretory cell, and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g010">Fig 10</xref>).

One intrinsic limitation of reporter genes is that they do not necessarily capture the full complement of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory control elements of a gene. However, given the compact nature of csGPCR loci, the inclusion of all 5&#x02019; regions in most reporters and the small size of introns, the number of inaccuracies may be quite limited. Irrespective of whether the reporters are a reflection of the complete expression of a csGPCR, they nevertheless function as highly valuable molecular markers of cellular identity and plasticity. Meaning, reporter gene analysis decodes <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory information and provides read-outs of regulatory states of specific cell types. The key conclusions of the expression patterns inferred from the reporter genes are as follows:</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Restricted expression</title><p>Most csGPCRs show a very restricted expression in few cell types. Many are expressed in single neuron classes. Those csGPCRs that express in multiple neuron classes do not display a coherent set of coexpressing neurons, with one notable exception: the nociceptive ASH, PHA, and PHB neurons express similar (but not identical) sets of csGPCRs.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>csGPCR coexpression within a neuron class</title><p>Some neurons coexpress a remarkably large number of GPCRs. The ASI neuron displays the most csGPCR genes at 99, followed by many distinct types of nociceptive neurons. While csGPCRs have been found for all but two sensory neurons (URY and ADE), there is a striking disparity in the number of csGPCRs coexpressed in sensory neuron classes. Amphid sensory neurons clearly coexpress the largest number of csGPCRs, while other sensory neurons express many fewer csGPCRs. The nociceptive ADL stands out in the list of amphid neurons, as it is the neuron expressing the most single-neuron&#x02013;specific csGPCR reporters.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Expression in sensory and non-sensory neuron classes</title><p>While expression of csGPCRs clearly predominates in sensory neurons, they are also expressed in inter- and motorneurons and in a diverse set of non-neuronal cells. In most cases, each GPCR is restrictively expressed, suggesting that many different cell types in an organism show very distinct and cell-type&#x02013;specific responses, possibly to internal signals. The similarity of one GPCR family, the <italic>srw</italic> family, to peptide receptors of other animal species provides hints to the nature of these ligands [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The expression of many members of the <italic>srr</italic> family in pharyngeal tissues suggests another source of ligands; perhaps these receptors respond to cues from ingested bacteria. In vertebrates, chemosensory GPCRs are now also becoming increasingly appreciated as being expressed in non-neuronal cells [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Polymodality of sensory neurons</title><p>csGPCRs were detected in sensory neurons that are known to express distinct types of sensory receptors and engage in non-chemosensory behavior, e.g., in gas-sensing neurons or different types of mechanosensory neurons. The expression of csGPCRs in these neuron classes may hint toward these neurons perceiving different sensory inputs, i.e., they are likely polymodal. However, as discussed above, csGPCRs expressed in these neurons may not be involved in detecting external sensory cues, but measuring internal states.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Absence of gene family themes</title><p>The absence of any overarching expression theme within gene families is striking. We did not observe that the expression of family members clusters in specific neuron classes or share any other specific expression features. Specifically: (a) left/right asymmetrically-expressed csGPCRs in the AWC neurons do not fall into the same family; (b) csGPCR reporters that are differentially regulated in larval stages or in the dauer stage do not come from a single family; (c) csGPCRs that share specific expression pattern themes (e.g., coexpression in the nociceptive ASH, PHA, and PHB neurons) do not derive from specific families; (d) non-sensory neuron-expressed or non-neuronal expressed csGPCRs do not fall into a specific family. The only glimpse of perhaps some common function is observed in the small <italic>srr</italic> family (nine genes), half of which appear to be expressed in non-neuronal pharyngeal tissue. An important note of caution is that these conclusions are based only on reporter genes. However, the substantial sample size on which these conclusions are based lends some credence to these conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Combinatorial complexity</title><p>csGPCRs generally act as homo- or heterodimers [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], thereby hugely increasing the amount of distinct sensory receptor complexes expressed in a cell. This combinatorial activity also makes prediction of function of a given csGPCR very difficult in that a csGPCR may have one function expressed in one cell (in combination with another csGPCR), while it may have a very different function in another cell (in combination with yet another csGPCR).</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Left/right asymmetric csGPCR expression patterns</title><p>While we recovered novel csGPCR genes expressed in a left/right asymmetric manner in the AWC neuron pair, we were surprised to find no other obvious left/right asymmetries in other sensory neuron pairs. Of course, such asymmetries may still be found with currently not analyzed csGPCR genes, but the number of AWC asymmetries recovered suggests that AWC neurons may be exceptional in their extent of lateralization.</p><p>The only other asymmetry that we found revealed itself not in a sensory, but an interneuron, and only in a non-anticipated context. The <italic>sri-9</italic> reporter transgene becomes induced in dauer animals in PVPL, but not PVPR, and PVPL expression is retained in postdauer animals. Molecular asymmetries in PVP neurons have not previously been reported but can perhaps be inferred by the fact that PVPL and PVPR are innervated in a left/right asymmetric manner by unilateral neurons. Specifically, PVPL, but not PVPR, is innervated by the unilateral DVB neuron. Perhaps <italic>sri-9</italic> may play a role in this synaptic signaling context, but why this should be dauer-specific is unclear.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Plasticity of csGPCR expression</title><p>One notable feature of our analysis was the extent of plasticity that csGPCR reporters show in the context of the dauer stage. Dauer animals are thought to remodel most tissue types and significantly alter behavioral patterns. Changes in csGPCR expression, and hence changes in the external and internal signal perception, fit very well into the mold of organismal plasticity and illustrate the plasticity of many different tissue types (note, for example, the changes in csGPCR expression in muscle). We find it particularly intriguing that several csGPCRs represent markers of life history. Some of the changes in csGPCR reporter gene expression in dauers is retained in post-dauer animals and some csGPCR reporters turn on only in postdauer animals. Animal-wide expression transcriptomic analysis has previously identified large cohorts of transcripts that, like our csGPCR reporters, serve as markers of dauer life history, i.e., transcripts change in dauers and some of these transcript changes persist in post-dauer animals [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. However, due to the whole animal nature of this analysis, this previous study lacked cellular resolution. Our findings add a novel spatial component to these previous findings, since we find the life history traits to be strikingly neuron class-specific. The expression of the TRP channel gene <italic>osm-9</italic> has also previously been shown to be modulated during dauer and post-dauer stages in a neuron class-specific manner; in this case, <italic>osm-9</italic> expression is down-regulated in the ADL (but not AWA) chemosensory neurons and the repression is retained post-dauer, using RNAi and chromatin-based mechanisms [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In all except one case that we report here, we observe the opposite post-dauer effect; reporters that are turned on in dauers persist in non-dauers. The mechanistic basis of this may hence be distinct from the <italic>osm-9</italic> case.</p><p>It is important to remember here that the life history trait observations are based on transcriptional reporter genes which, on the one hand, may not accurately reflect expression of the endogenous locus, but, on the other hand, clearly provide a definitive molecular &#x0201c;read out&#x0201d; of changes in the &#x0201c;regulatory state&#x0201d; of specific neuron types, depending on whether they have passed through the dauer stage or not. Moreover, our transcriptional reporters also argue that the life history regulatory phenomenon must be transcriptional in nature. These csGPCR reporters will therefore provide excellent starting points to analyze the molecular mechanisms controlling this plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Future uses of the csGPCR expression map</title><p>The csGPCR reporter atlas can be put to a number of future uses. The sites of expression of specific csGPCRs point to potential functions of the csGCPRs, guiding the future analysis of csGPCR knockout strains. For example, csGPCRs expressed in the polymodal nociceptive ASH, ADL and phasmid neurons may be mediating the response to a number of distinct sensory cues processed by these neurons [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p><p>csGPCR expression patterns point to perhaps unexpected cellular sites of internal signal perception that warrant further investigation. For example, the excretory canal cell expresses at least six csGPCRs reporters (considering that we only examined reporters for approximately 20% of GPCR loci, this number may increase several fold). The relevance of this expression could be tested through the excretory cell-specific expression of dominant negative versions of G-protein downstream signaling components. Similarly, the cellular dynamics in csGPCR expression patterns point to specific cells undergoing changes that warrant future characterization. For example, the induction or suppression of csGPCR reporter expression during the dauer stage in specific sensory and interneurons that were not previously associated with dauer-specific functions may warrant a closer examination of other molecular and functional changes of these neurons during the dauer stage.</p><p>Because csGPCR reporter fusions also link precisely delineated sequences (used for reporter construction) to specific cellular sites of gene expression, patterns of coexpression of GPCRs can be used to extract <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory information, which in turn may point to <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors involved in controlling GPCR gene expression. A proof of principle for this type of analysis has already been conducted, pointing to a critical function of, for example, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor in controlling csGPCR expression in the ADL nociceptive neuron [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and with now substantially more expression information available can be further extended to additional cell types.</p><p>Lastly, green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter transgenes have generally served as invaluable starting points for genetic mutant screens in which the genetic control of specific biological processes can be investigated. The csGPCR reporter collection provides a multitude of entry points. For example, the post-dauer expression of multiple reporter genes can be used to screen for mutants in which these life history traits fail to be properly expressed. GFP reporter genes have also served as invaluable cellular identity markers and here again the csGPCR reporter collection can be used to assess how the identity of specific cell types is genetically controlled.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec031"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.2004218.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>csGPCR gene locus analysis.</title><p>(A) Histogram of upstream intergenic region distances of all <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> csGPCR genes.</p><p>The average size of the 5&#x02019; intergenic region (= distance to next gene) is 1.8 kb.</p><p>Eighty-nine percent of all loci have a 5&#x02019; intergenic region smaller than 4 kb.</p><p>(B) Histogram of average combined intron length (bp) per GPCR gene.</p><p>(C) The intergenic region of the majority of GPCR is substantially larger</p><p>than the combined intronic region. bp, base pair; csGPCR, chemosensory-type GPCRs; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.2004218.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.2004218.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Masterlist of all examined GPCR reporters.</title><p>GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor protein.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.2004218.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.2004218.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>List of all identified sensory neurons with GPCR expression.</title><p>Gene in bold: newly identified in this paper</p><p>Gene in non-bold: previously identified</p><p>(Gene in parenthesis): ID based on position and morphology, not confirmed with neuron-specific reporter.</p><p>GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor protein.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.2004218.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.2004218.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Primers.</title><p>Primer sequences for the reporters generated by the Vancouver consortium (BC strains) can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gfpworm.org">http://www.gfpworm.org</ext-link>.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.2004218.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Q.

Such maps provide important starting points for neuron classification, for functional analysis, and for developmental studies aimed at defining the molecular mechanisms of neuron identity acquisition and neuron identity diversification. In this resource paper, we describe a nervous system-wide map of the potential expression sites of 244 members of the largest gene family in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genome, rhodopsin-like (class A) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) chemoreceptors, using classic <italic>gfp</italic> reporter gene technology. We cover representatives of all sequence families of chemoreceptor GPCRs, some of which were previously entirely uncharacterized. Most reporters are expressed in a very restricted number of cells, often just in single cells. We assign GPCR reporter expression to all but two of the 37 sensory neuron classes of the sex-shared, core nervous system. Some sensory neurons express a very small number of receptors, while others, particularly nociceptive neurons, coexpress several dozen GPCR reporter genes. GPCR reporters are also expressed in a wide range of inter- and motorneurons, as well as non-neuronal cells, suggesting that GPCRs may constitute receptors not just for environmental signals, but also for internal cues. We observe only one notable, frequent association of coexpression patterns, namely in one nociceptive amphid (ASH) and two nociceptive phasmid sensory neurons (PHA, PHB). We identified GPCRs with sexually dimorphic expression and several GPCR reporters that are expressed in a left/right asymmetric manner. We identified a substantial degree of GPCR expression plasticity; particularly in the context of the environmentally-induced dauer diapause stage when one third of all tested GPCRs alter the cellular specificity of their expression within and outside the nervous system. Intriguingly, in a number of cases, the dauer-specific alterations of GPCR reporter expression in specific neuron classes are maintained during postdauer life and in some case new patterns are induced post-dauer, demonstrating that GPCR gene expression may serve as traits of life history. Taken together, our resource provides an entry point for functional studies and also offers a host of molecular markers for studying molecular patterning and plasticity of the nervous system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Maps of gene expression patterns in nervous systems provide an important resource for neuron classification, for functional analysis, and for developmental studies that ask how different neurons acquire their unique identities. By analyzing transgenic GFP reporter strains, we describe here the expression pattern of 244 putative chemosensory receptor-encoding genes, which constitute the largest gene family in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. As expected, chemoreceptor expression is enriched in chemosensory neurons. Putative chemoreceptors are also expressed in a wide range of interneurons and motor neurons, as well as non-neuronal cells, suggesting that these receptors may sense internal cues in addition to environmental signals. Each chemoreceptor is expressed sparsely, often in just one neuron type, but each neuron type can express many chemoreceptors. Chemoreceptor expression is remarkably plastic, particularly in the context of the environmentally induced dauer diapause stage. Taken together, this molecular atlas of chemosensory receptors provides an entry point for functional studies and offers a host of markers for studying neuronal patterning and plasticity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>NIH (grant number 1F31NS096863) to EAB.

Molecular markers that are constitutively and invariably expressed throughout the life of a specific neuron type provide static views of neuronal identity and hence provide entry points to study how invariable identity features are acquired during neuronal differentiation [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In contrast, some molecular features of a neuron display a remarkable plasticity in that their expression may be regulated by neuronal activity or in response to specific environmental cues. Such genes serve as markers to understand the nature of the gene regulatory programs that govern such dynamic features of a neuron. We reasoned that a significant expansion of the expression analysis of chemosensory G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), initiated more than 20 years ago [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] using <italic>gfp</italic>-based reporter gene technology [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], may yield a significantly expanded resource of molecular markers that may label various aspects of neuronal identity and neuronal plasticity in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> nervous system.</p><p>Animal genomes encode five major classes of GPCRs, of which the rhodopsin class (or &#x0201c;class A&#x0201d;) is the largest class [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t001">Table 1</xref>). Rhodopsin class GPCRs can be subdivided into phylogenetically deeply conserved neurotransmitter receptors (neuropeptides, acetylcholine, biogenic amines) as well as non-conserved, chemosensory-type GPCRs (csGPCRs) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t001">Table 1</xref>). The csGPCRs have independently expanded in distinct animal phyla where they serve to respond to diverse, physiologically relevant external and, supposedly, internal cues [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

The majority of these 76 reporters revealed expression in chemosensory neurons [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Based on the molecular classification of csGPCRs into defined families, we were also interested in determining whether the expression of specific subfamilies&#x02014;particularly those whose expression has not previously been examined&#x02014;may reveal specific common themes (i.e., patterns of coexpression or expression in specific cells) that may provide a hint to their function.

The obvious shortcoming of this technology is that reporter genes may not capture the full <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory content of the respective GPCR-encoding locus, but as we will describe in more detail below, most GPCR-encoding loci are compact with small intergenic regions and introns. We emphasize that our approach is not necessarily aimed at identifying the complete set of cells expressing a GPCR, but, following ample precedent, is rather aimed at identifying novel and informative patterns of expression, as incomplete as these patterns may be.</p><p>We utilized two sources of csGPCR reporters. A consortium at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver) has generated a valuable, large panel of reporters for 1886 genes in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genome [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, the site of expression of these reporters has not been determined with single cell resolution in the nervous system. We obtained 100 reporters from this collection that targeted GPCR loci, and for every reporter that produced a stable pattern of expression we undertook a detailed analysis of their sites of expression in the nervous system.</p><p>In addition to these 100 reporter genes, we generated 144 of our own reporter genes. We adhered to the following principles in the choice of genes and design of reporters: first, we aimed to cover all 23 classes of chemoreceptor genes defined by Thomas and Robertson [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t002">Table 2</xref>). Using phylogenetic trees assembled by Thomas and Robertson, we sampled each gene family evenly, generally avoiding the examination of close sequence paralogues, which we anticipated to reveal similar expression patterns.</p><p>Our own reporters mostly contain all 5&#x02019; intergenic regions fused to <italic>gfp</italic> and contain, at most, 4 kb of sequence. The rationale behind this choice lies in the overall organization of GPCR loci (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004218.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Eighty-nine percent of the approximately 1,300 csGPCR loci contain 5&#x02019; intergenic regions of less than 4 kb. We chose all of our samples from this pool, and, hence, all the reporters generated by us capture the full intergenic region. The reporters from the Vancouver consortium contain about 3 kb of 5&#x02019; intergenic region, at most [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Furthermore, csGPCR loci tend to have small introns (average size 432 base pairs; almost half of them &#x0003c;200 base pairs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004218.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), indicating that relatively little <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory information resides in these introns, which provided the basis for our focus on intergenic regions. For some genes with very short upstream intergenic regions (less than 500 bp) we included the first intron (if this was 300 base pairs or larger) in order to increase the regulatory space contained in the reporters. The coordinates for all reporter constructs can be found in the Supplementary Material.</p><p>Sites of expression within the nervous system were determined mainly for those reporters with the most robust expression patterns and was based on stereotyped cell position, cellular and process morphology, and co-labeling with either DiD (which labels a subset of sensory neurons) or by crossing with landmark strains in which specific neuron classes are labeled with a red fluorescent protein (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Material and methods</xref>). All cell identification was initially done in young adult hermaphrodite animals. As we will describe in detail later, a number of these reporter strains were also subjected to analysis at different stages, under different conditions, and in the two different sexes.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>GPCRs are expressed in restricted patterns within and outside the nervous system</title><p>In our ensuing description of expression patterns of reporter genes, we summarize the expression observed with the previously described reporters, as well as the additional reporters analyzed by us.

We find that every sensory neuron, except for URY and ADE neurons, expresses at least 1 GPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g001">Fig 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004218.s003">S2 Table</xref>). The number of GPCRs expressed in a given neuron class shows a striking range. The ASI neuron class expresses an impressive 99 GPCR reporters. After ASI, the nociceptive neurons ADL and ASH together with the phasmid neurons PHA and PHB are the sensory neuron classes with higher numbers of GPCRs, expressing 72, 51, 51, and 49 reporters, respectively. Outside the amphid and phasmid neurons, the number of reporters expressed in sensory neurons dramatically drops, with all other sensory neurons expressing less than 10 GPCRs, in some cases only a single GPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g001">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004218.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Of course, it needs to be kept in mind that we only consider expression of a fraction of the csGPCR loci, and hence each of these total numbers is expected to increase by several fold once all csGPCR expression patterns are identified.</p><p>Twenty-four percent of the GPCR reporters for which we have information about neuron numbers are exclusively expressed in a single neuron class, and in all these cases the neuron class is a sensory neuron class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g002">Fig 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004218.s004">S3 Table</xref>).

The ADL-expressed, single-neuron&#x02013;specific GPCRs do not fall into a specific GPCR subfamily but rather cover 7 distinct families.

In light of the inter-/motorneuron expression of csGPCR reporters, we can hypothesize that csGPCR reporters that are expressed in sensory neurons may actually not function as receptors for external sensory cues, but may rather function as they likely do in inter-/motorneurons, i.e., as receptors of internal signals.</p><p>We asked whether csGPCR expression profiles cluster by neuron class. To this end, we undertook unsupervised hierarchical clustering of expression profiles. The BP value for most associations was very weak with two exceptions: csGPCR reporters are often coexpressed in the two tail phasmid neuron classes PHA and PHB (AU/BP &#x0003e; 95), and expression in either or both of the phasmid neurons is associated with the expression in the head neuron ASH (AU/BP &#x0003e; 95) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The ASH, PHA and PHB neuron classes are not closely related by lineage but all of these three neuron classes are nociceptive neurons that respond to similar cues and integrate sensory inputs from the head and tail [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and that directly innervate command interneurons involved in reversal behavior [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While csGPCRs expressed in these neurons are likely involved in sensing nociceptive cues, it is notable that these coexpressed csGPCRs came from widely distinct csGPCR families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio.2004218.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.2004218.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>The only coexpression association of csGPCR reporters is in nociceptive neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Graphical representation of ASH, PHA, and PHB coexpression.

Also, non-neuronally expressed GPCR receptors are not biased toward a single subfamily. GPCRs expressed in non-neuronal tissues that are exposed to the environment, e.g., epidermis, could be involved in sensing external cues, but other non-neuronal cells will rather respond to internal signals. As a cautionary note, we can not presently exclude that non-neuronal expression may be the result of lack of repressor elements in the reporter constructs, but we note that in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> there is presently little evidence for non-neuronal repressor mechanisms restricting gene expression to the nervous system (e.g., [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]).</p><fig id="pbio.2004218.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.2004218.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Expression of non-neuronal csGPCR reporters.</title><p>Examples of GPCR reporters expressed in different types of non-neuronal tissue in young adult hermaphrodites.

As described above, specific features of csGPCR expression patterns do not correlate with family membership, but we wanted to pursue this issue further via a more comprehensive analysis of entire chemoreceptor gene families. As defined by sequence analysis [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], chemoreceptor gene families have very different sizes, ranging from a single gene per family (<italic>srn</italic> family) to 223 genes per family (<italic>srh</italic> family) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t002">Table 2</xref>). We analyzed reporter gene expression patterns of all members of two small families to examine whether there are common themes in their expression patterns, their genomic location, and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory control regions. We also analyzed the expression of the one family, the <italic>srn</italic> family, which only has a single member and is highly conserved in other <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, to assess whether it may show an unusual expression pattern. However, we find the <italic>srn-1</italic> reporter gene to be mainly expressed in amphid sensory neurons, like many other csGPCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio.2004218.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.2004218.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Reporter analysis of entire csGPCR families.</title><p>Genomic loci, reporter scheme, and gfp expression images for the <italic>srm</italic> (<bold>A</bold>), <italic>srr</italic> (<bold>B</bold>), and <italic>srn</italic> (<bold>C</bold>) GPCR gene families.

We focused on dynamics that relate to developmental timing and the response to harsh environmental conditions. To facilitate the identification of changes in expression, we focused our analysis on GPCRs that are robustly expressed in the adult in a small number of neurons (in most cases not more than 1&#x02013;3 neuron pairs in the head and/or 1&#x02013;2 neuron pairs in the tail). At the first larval (L1) stage, we did not detect any differences in expression in 79 out of 82 examined reporters, compared to adults. Due to the limitations of multicopy array-based fluorescent reporters, moderate intensity changes within a cell type might be difficult to notice and could have been missed. Three reporter genes, <italic>srh-11</italic>, <italic>sru-48</italic>, and <italic>sra-28</italic>, show striking differences in L1 versus adult stages: all three reporter genes show expression in the ASK neuron at the L1 stage, but not at the adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Additionally, <italic>srh-11</italic> is expressed brightly in the ASI neuron at the L1 stage but dimly at the adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g009">Fig 9</xref>).

Initially again focusing on reporters that are expressed in a restricted number of neurons under well-fed conditions, we found that 16 out of 46 examined reporters show a diverse set of changes in animals that were sent into the dauer stage via a standard starvation/crowding protocol (see Experimental Procedures). Many of the changes entail striking changes in the cellular specificity of GPCR reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g010">Fig 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t005">Table 5</xref>). The vast majority of differences are observed in the nervous system, but some changes also occur outside the nervous system. Changes in GPCR reporter expression in the dauer stage have previously been described for two GPCR reporters [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (summarized with our novel patterns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t005">Table 5</xref>), but the patterns we observe here are much broader and more complex. They can be summarized as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>In most cases, there is stable and unchanged expression in several neuron classes in dauer and non-dauers, but upon dauer entry, expression is either turned on in additional neuron classes (&#x0201c;type I&#x0201d; regulation) or becomes undetectable in subsets of specific neuron classes (&#x0201c;type II&#x0201d; regulation) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t005">Table 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g010">Fig 10</xref>). There are also combinations of both changes (type III regulation): in one particularly striking example, the <italic>srh-71</italic> reporter is expressed in some sensory neurons in both dauer and non-dauers, but undergoes a striking respecification in dauers. Reporter expression becomes undetectable in the lateral IL2, PHA, and an additional pair of tail neurons in dauer, and instead is turned on in the AIZ and ASG neurons (and increases expression levels in ASI). This hints toward the rerouting of internal sensory information.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In a number of cases, reporter expression is strongly down-regulated, becoming undetectable in all neurons in which the reporter is expressed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004218.t005">Table 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The changes outside the nervous system concern three tissue types: muscle, the excretory cell, and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004218.g010">Fig 10</xref>).

One intrinsic limitation of reporter genes is that they do not necessarily capture the full complement of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory control elements of a gene. However, given the compact nature of csGPCR loci, the inclusion of all 5&#x02019; regions in most reporters and the small size of introns, the number of inaccuracies may be quite limited. Irrespective of whether the reporters are a reflection of the complete expression of a csGPCR, they nevertheless function as highly valuable molecular markers of cellular identity and plasticity. Meaning, reporter gene analysis decodes <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory information and provides read-outs of regulatory states of specific cell types. The key conclusions of the expression patterns inferred from the reporter genes are as follows:</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Restricted expression</title><p>Most csGPCRs show a very restricted expression in few cell types. Many are expressed in single neuron classes. Those csGPCRs that express in multiple neuron classes do not display a coherent set of coexpressing neurons, with one notable exception: the nociceptive ASH, PHA, and PHB neurons express similar (but not identical) sets of csGPCRs.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>csGPCR coexpression within a neuron class</title><p>Some neurons coexpress a remarkably large number of GPCRs. The ASI neuron displays the most csGPCR genes at 99, followed by many distinct types of nociceptive neurons. While csGPCRs have been found for all but two sensory neurons (URY and ADE), there is a striking disparity in the number of csGPCRs coexpressed in sensory neuron classes. Amphid sensory neurons clearly coexpress the largest number of csGPCRs, while other sensory neurons express many fewer csGPCRs. The nociceptive ADL stands out in the list of amphid neurons, as it is the neuron expressing the most single-neuron&#x02013;specific csGPCR reporters.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Expression in sensory and non-sensory neuron classes</title><p>While expression of csGPCRs clearly predominates in sensory neurons, they are also expressed in inter- and motorneurons and in a diverse set of non-neuronal cells. In most cases, each GPCR is restrictively expressed, suggesting that many different cell types in an organism show very distinct and cell-type&#x02013;specific responses, possibly to internal signals. The similarity of one GPCR family, the <italic>srw</italic> family, to peptide receptors of other animal species provides hints to the nature of these ligands [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The expression of many members of the <italic>srr</italic> family in pharyngeal tissues suggests another source of ligands; perhaps these receptors respond to cues from ingested bacteria. In vertebrates, chemosensory GPCRs are now also becoming increasingly appreciated as being expressed in non-neuronal cells [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Polymodality of sensory neurons</title><p>csGPCRs were detected in sensory neurons that are known to express distinct types of sensory receptors and engage in non-chemosensory behavior, e.g., in gas-sensing neurons or different types of mechanosensory neurons. The expression of csGPCRs in these neuron classes may hint toward these neurons perceiving different sensory inputs, i.e., they are likely polymodal. However, as discussed above, csGPCRs expressed in these neurons may not be involved in detecting external sensory cues, but measuring internal states.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Absence of gene family themes</title><p>The absence of any overarching expression theme within gene families is striking. We did not observe that the expression of family members clusters in specific neuron classes or share any other specific expression features. Specifically: (a) left/right asymmetrically-expressed csGPCRs in the AWC neurons do not fall into the same family; (b) csGPCR reporters that are differentially regulated in larval stages or in the dauer stage do not come from a single family; (c) csGPCRs that share specific expression pattern themes (e.g., coexpression in the nociceptive ASH, PHA, and PHB neurons) do not derive from specific families; (d) non-sensory neuron-expressed or non-neuronal expressed csGPCRs do not fall into a specific family. The only glimpse of perhaps some common function is observed in the small <italic>srr</italic> family (nine genes), half of which appear to be expressed in non-neuronal pharyngeal tissue. An important note of caution is that these conclusions are based only on reporter genes. However, the substantial sample size on which these conclusions are based lends some credence to these conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Combinatorial complexity</title><p>csGPCRs generally act as homo- or heterodimers [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], thereby hugely increasing the amount of distinct sensory receptor complexes expressed in a cell. This combinatorial activity also makes prediction of function of a given csGPCR very difficult in that a csGPCR may have one function expressed in one cell (in combination with another csGPCR), while it may have a very different function in another cell (in combination with yet another csGPCR).</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Left/right asymmetric csGPCR expression patterns</title><p>While we recovered novel csGPCR genes expressed in a left/right asymmetric manner in the AWC neuron pair, we were surprised to find no other obvious left/right asymmetries in other sensory neuron pairs. Of course, such asymmetries may still be found with currently not analyzed csGPCR genes, but the number of AWC asymmetries recovered suggests that AWC neurons may be exceptional in their extent of lateralization.</p><p>The only other asymmetry that we found revealed itself not in a sensory, but an interneuron, and only in a non-anticipated context. The <italic>sri-9</italic> reporter transgene becomes induced in dauer animals in PVPL, but not PVPR, and PVPL expression is retained in postdauer animals. Molecular asymmetries in PVP neurons have not previously been reported but can perhaps be inferred by the fact that PVPL and PVPR are innervated in a left/right asymmetric manner by unilateral neurons. Specifically, PVPL, but not PVPR, is innervated by the unilateral DVB neuron. Perhaps <italic>sri-9</italic> may play a role in this synaptic signaling context, but why this should be dauer-specific is unclear.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Plasticity of csGPCR expression</title><p>One notable feature of our analysis was the extent of plasticity that csGPCR reporters show in the context of the dauer stage. Dauer animals are thought to remodel most tissue types and significantly alter behavioral patterns. Changes in csGPCR expression, and hence changes in the external and internal signal perception, fit very well into the mold of organismal plasticity and illustrate the plasticity of many different tissue types (note, for example, the changes in csGPCR expression in muscle). We find it particularly intriguing that several csGPCRs represent markers of life history. Some of the changes in csGPCR reporter gene expression in dauers is retained in post-dauer animals and some csGPCR reporters turn on only in postdauer animals. Animal-wide expression transcriptomic analysis has previously identified large cohorts of transcripts that, like our csGPCR reporters, serve as markers of dauer life history, i.e., transcripts change in dauers and some of these transcript changes persist in post-dauer animals [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. However, due to the whole animal nature of this analysis, this previous study lacked cellular resolution. Our findings add a novel spatial component to these previous findings, since we find the life history traits to be strikingly neuron class-specific. The expression of the TRP channel gene <italic>osm-9</italic> has also previously been shown to be modulated during dauer and post-dauer stages in a neuron class-specific manner; in this case, <italic>osm-9</italic> expression is down-regulated in the ADL (but not AWA) chemosensory neurons and the repression is retained post-dauer, using RNAi and chromatin-based mechanisms [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In all except one case that we report here, we observe the opposite post-dauer effect; reporters that are turned on in dauers persist in non-dauers. The mechanistic basis of this may hence be distinct from the <italic>osm-9</italic> case.</p><p>It is important to remember here that the life history trait observations are based on transcriptional reporter genes which, on the one hand, may not accurately reflect expression of the endogenous locus, but, on the other hand, clearly provide a definitive molecular &#x0201c;read out&#x0201d; of changes in the &#x0201c;regulatory state&#x0201d; of specific neuron types, depending on whether they have passed through the dauer stage or not. Moreover, our transcriptional reporters also argue that the life history regulatory phenomenon must be transcriptional in nature. These csGPCR reporters will therefore provide excellent starting points to analyze the molecular mechanisms controlling this plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Future uses of the csGPCR expression map</title><p>The csGPCR reporter atlas can be put to a number of future uses. The sites of expression of specific csGPCRs point to potential functions of the csGCPRs, guiding the future analysis of csGPCR knockout strains. For example, csGPCRs expressed in the polymodal nociceptive ASH, ADL and phasmid neurons may be mediating the response to a number of distinct sensory cues processed by these neurons [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p><p>csGPCR expression patterns point to perhaps unexpected cellular sites of internal signal perception that warrant further investigation. For example, the excretory canal cell expresses at least six csGPCRs reporters (considering that we only examined reporters for approximately 20% of GPCR loci, this number may increase several fold). The relevance of this expression could be tested through the excretory cell-specific expression of dominant negative versions of G-protein downstream signaling components. Similarly, the cellular dynamics in csGPCR expression patterns point to specific cells undergoing changes that warrant future characterization. For example, the induction or suppression of csGPCR reporter expression during the dauer stage in specific sensory and interneurons that were not previously associated with dauer-specific functions may warrant a closer examination of other molecular and functional changes of these neurons during the dauer stage.</p><p>Because csGPCR reporter fusions also link precisely delineated sequences (used for reporter construction) to specific cellular sites of gene expression, patterns of coexpression of GPCRs can be used to extract <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory information, which in turn may point to <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors involved in controlling GPCR gene expression. A proof of principle for this type of analysis has already been conducted, pointing to a critical function of, for example, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor in controlling csGPCR expression in the ADL nociceptive neuron [<xref rid="pbio.2004218.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and with now substantially more expression information available can be further extended to additional cell types.</p><p>Lastly, green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter transgenes have generally served as invaluable starting points for genetic mutant screens in which the genetic control of specific biological processes can be investigated. The csGPCR reporter collection provides a multitude of entry points. For example, the post-dauer expression of multiple reporter genes can be used to screen for mutants in which these life history traits fail to be properly expressed.
