</related-article><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Structure-function studies reveal how a poxvirus protein blocks cell surface display of MHC class I by exploiting cellular ER retrieval processes.</p></abstract><abstract><p>One of the hallmarks of viral immune evasion is the capacity to disrupt major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) antigen presentation to evade T-cell detection. Cowpox virus encoded protein CPXV203 blocks MHCI surface expression by exploiting the KDEL-receptor recycling pathway, and here we show that CPXV203 directly binds a wide array of fully assembled MHCI proteins, both classical and non-classical. Further, the stability of CPXV203/MHCI complexes is highly pH dependent, with dramatically increased affinities at the lower pH of the Golgi relative to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Crystallographic studies reveal that CPXV203 adopts a beta-sandwich fold similar to poxvirus chemokine binding proteins, and binds the same highly conserved MHCI determinants located under the peptide-binding platform that tapasin, CD8, and natural killer (NK)-receptors engage. Mutagenesis of the CPXV203/MHCI interface identified the importance of two CPXV203 His residues that confer low pH stabilization of the complex and are critical to ER retrieval of MHCI. These studies clarify mechanistically how CPXV203 coordinates with other cowpox proteins to thwart antigen presentation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Viruses encode a wide array of proteins whose principle function is to disable the surveillance and effector functions of the immune system. A common viral target is the MHC class I antigen processing and presentation pathway, which is a potent mechanism used by the host for the detection and killing of virally infected cells. In this study we have delineated the immune evasion mechanism of the cowpox-encoded CPXV203 protein, which is known to potently block the normal trafficking of MHCI from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane. CPXV203 does this by highjacking an ER-retrieval system that usually serves to capture defective, chaperone complexed MHCI proteins in the Golgi and send them to the ER. We show that CPXV203 adopts a compact beta-sandwich structure and engages evolutionarily conserved MHCI determinants that are located under the peptide-binding platform. The viral protein binds a variety of different MHCI proteins weakly at the pH found in the ER, but the affinity and half-life are significantly augmented at the more acidic conditions found in the Golgi. Together these data suggest that CPXV203 works cooperatively with the endogenous ER retrieval process to promiscuously target fully assembled MHCI, thereby preventing T-cell killing of cowpox infected cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by the NIAID R01 AI019687, U54 AI057160 (MRCE) and the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases (CSGID) contract numbers HHSN272200700058C and HHSN272201200026C.

Not surprisingly, a wide variety of viruses have evolved mechanisms to disrupt antigen presentation by targeting the assembly and trafficking pathways used by MHCI proteins <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Lilley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The most common immune evasion mechanism appears to be blockade of cytosol-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) peptide transport by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Frh1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Horst1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, other viruses target molecular chaperones to impair the quality of peptide loading without curtailing peptide supply <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The quality of peptide loading by MHCI is initially controlled by the peptide loading complex (PLC) made up of TAP, tapasin (Tpn), ERp57, and calreticulin (CRT) <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Peaper1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Prior to binding an optimal peptide, the PLC retains in the ER nascent MHCI heavy chains (HCs) assembled with beta-2 microglobulin (&#x003b2;2m). Within the PLC, the MHCI-dedicated chaperone Tpn bridges the HC/&#x003b2;2m complex with TAP. Once a peptide of suitable affinity binds to the HC/&#x003b2;2m complex, the fully assembled MHCI is released from the PLC to transit to the cell surface; and perhaps not surprisingly, there are examples of viral immune evasion proteins that impair peptide loading by blocking PLC assembly <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition to PLC-imposed quality control, non-PLC-associated CRT uses a KDEL-dependent mechanism to retrieve suboptimally loaded MHCI from the early Golgi to the ER to improve peptide binding <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Howe1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This ER retrieval is dependent upon the C-terminal KDEL sequence of CRT that confers binding to the KDEL receptor (KDELR) in the early Golgi in a pH-dependent manner <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Capitani1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Several viral immune evasion proteins appear to directly target MHCI proteins, but only adenovirus (AdV) E3-19K and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) US2 have been shown to directly bind MHCI luminal domains <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Kmpe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Gewurz1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. E3-19K impairs MHCI egress from the ER by either an ER-retention mechanism dependent on its cytoplasmic tail <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Pbo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> or its ability to prevent Tpn bridging MHCI to TAP <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, while US2 targets MHCI for ER-associated degradation (ERAD) <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Wiertz1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. E3-19K and US2 both exhibit distinct class Ia allele preferences <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Burgert1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> that may help these viruses evade natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity on the basis of missing self <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Yokoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Alternatively, viruses may encode separate proteins to undermine NK cell surveillance <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Interestingly, E3-19K has also been reported to target various MHCI assembly intermediates, and mutagenesis analyses suggest that E3-19K may interact with an MHCI surface similar to that bound by US2 <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Burgert1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The only structural study of direct MHCI sabotage revealed that US2 uses an Ig-like fold to bind under the MHCI-binding platform near where the N-terminus of the peptide is anchored <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Gewurz2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Although US2 was crystallized bound to fully assembled MHCI, cellular studies suggest US2 also targets HC before full assembly with peptide and/or &#x003b2;2m <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Loureiro1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In any case, the structural basis for how US2, E3-19K, or any other viral immune evasion protein discriminates MHCI alleles and/or assembly intermediates has not been previously reported.</p><p>While many viruses exhibit strict host specificity, some orthopoxviruses are able to productively infect a wide variety of mammalian species and encode an array of immunomodulatory genes that target both cell intrinsic and extrinsic antiviral responses <xref rid="pbio.1001432-McFadden1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Yet until recently, orthopoxviruses were not known to target antigen presentation. The orthopoxvirus cowpox (CPXV) expresses two unrelated immune evasion proteins, CPXV012 and CPXV203 (UniProt [UNP]: Q8QMP2), which use different mechanisms to block antigen presentation in both human and murine cells <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Byun1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Alzhanova1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. CPXV012 is a small type II transmembrane protein that blocks peptide transport by TAP <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Byun2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Alzhanova1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. By contrast, CPXV203 is a soluble protein that prevents MHCI proteins from trafficking to the plasma membrane by a mechanism dependent upon its C-terminal KTEL sequence, a motif recognized by the KDELR <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Byun1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. To initially probe binding partners, Byun et al. (2007) showed that CPXV203 co-precipitated with MHCI and not TAP. These findings implied that CPXV203 binds MHCI lumenal domains or an associated molecule before and/or after peptide assembly <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Byun1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, CPXV203 was found to down regulate MHCI proteins in both murine and human cell lines during normal poxvirus infection <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Byun2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Alzhanova1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This ability to broadly inhibit MHCI by CPXV203 may help explain productive CPXV zoonotic infection of various mammalian species other than small rodents, the apparent CPXV host reservoir <xref rid="pbio.1001432-McFadden1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Indeed, mutant cowpox viruses lacking both CPXV012 and CPXV203 demonstrate attenuated virulence in a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-dependent manner <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Byun2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, in contrast to other viral proteins that target MHCI that do not appear to significantly modulate primary infection in vivo <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Gold1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Hansen2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>Here we provide a precise understanding of how CPXV203 binds to a broad array of MHCI complexes that includes both classical and non-classical molecules. Biosensor studies indicate that CPXV203 binds MHCI weakly at the pH found in the ER, but the affinity and half-life are significantly augmented at the more acidic conditions found in the Golgi. Crystallographic analysis reveals that CPXV203 adopts a &#x003b2;-sandwich topology reminiscent of poxvirus chemokine-binding proteins, and this domain engages evolutionarily conserved MHCI determinants available only on fully assembled MHCI. We also undertook mutagenesis analysis that supports the structural model and uncovered the critical functional role played by two CPXV203 His residues in the pH regulation of complex stability. Together these data suggest that CPXV203 works cooperatively with the endogenous KDEL-mediated Golgi retrieval process to promiscuously target fully assembled MHCI, thereby preventing T-cell killing of cowpox infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CPXV203 Downregulates Fully Assembled MHCI</title><p>To ascertain which MHCI assembly state(s) is targeted by CPXV203, association with the HC of murine H-2K<sup>b</sup> (UNP: P01901) was monitored by co-precipitation in wild-type and &#x003b2;2m-deficient cells. CPXV203 only co-precipitated with K<sup>b</sup> HC in cells expressing &#x003b2;2m (UNP: Q91XJ8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001432-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that heterodimer assembly is required for CPXV203/MHCI association. To further assess whether this association was dependent upon the PLC, CPXV203 was expressed by transduction in cells lacking either TAP or Tpn, which present low levels of fully assembled MHCI. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001432-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, CPXV203 dramatically reduced MHCI surface expression in cells lacking TAP or Tpn, whereas the TAP inhibitor CPXV012 did not affect surface expression in these PLC-component deficient cells. We also found that CPXV203 comparably downregulates MHCI expression in cells with and without CRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001432-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that CPXV203 expression does not grossly disrupt CRT-associated ER quality control as could potentially occur through KDELR competition. In further support of this conclusion, CPXV203 does not interfere with PLC assembly, as shown by normal TAP/Tpn association and normal steady-state levels of CRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001432-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Previous studies found comparable peptide loading in cells with and without CPXV203, and failed to identify association of CPXV203 with the PLC <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Byun1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence that CPXV203 regulates the surface expression of fully assembled MHCI after dissociation from the PLC without impairing PLC function.</p><fig id="pbio-1001432-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1001432.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CPXV203 downregulation of MHCI is &#x003b2;2m-dependent but PLC-independent.</title><p>(A) Hemagglutinin-tagged CPXV203 (CPXV203-HA) stably expressed in &#x003b2;2m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells was unable to co-IP HC.

The expansion of these studies to additional MHCI molecules revealed that CPXV203 exhibits low affinity interactions (K<sub>D,Kin</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;82&#x02013;10,500 nM) with five different murine Ia alleles (D<sup>b</sup>, D<sup>q</sup>, K<sup>b</sup>, K<sup>d</sup>, L<sup>d</sup>) and a primate allele (Ceat-B*12) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001432.s005">Table S1</xref>). We also examined a non-classical MHC Ib protein, murine thymic leukemia tumor antigen or TL (T3<sup>b</sup>), which was engaged by CPXV203 with similar affinity and kinetics at pH<sub>ER</sub> 7.4 as observed for K<sup>b</sup>. Unlike classical MHCI proteins that require peptide loading to assemble, TL pairs with &#x003b2;2m and is stable in the absence of ligand binding. Thus, it appears that the requirement for peptide binding to classical MHC Ia proteins for CPXV203 engagement is based on the role peptide loading plays in assembly and stability rather than direct recognition. Promiscuous CPXV203/MHCI association fits well with the previously published data that CPXV203 downregulates murine H-2D and -K alleles, though the affinities were weaker than those previously reported for the viral ER retention protein E3-19K (11&#x02013;18 nM) <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><fig id="pbio-1001432-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1001432.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>CPXV203 binds MHCI with higher affinity at low pH.</title><p>(A,B) SPR analysis of CPXV203/K<sup>b</sup> binding at pH<sub>ER</sub> 7.4 (A) and pH<sub>Golgi</sub> 6.0 (B).

Subsequently, molecular replacement-single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MR-SAD) was used to identify eight SeMet sites and introduce anomalous phase information (figure of merit [FOM] 0.604) that improved map quality to the point where the complete CPXV203/MHCI complex could be built and refined. The structure reveals that CPXV203 binds below the MHCI peptide-binding platform, contacting both the HC (&#x003b1;2- and &#x003b1;3-domains) and &#x003b2;2m. Comparison of K<sup>b</sup> free and bound by CPXV203 did not indicate any significant changes associated with viral protein engagement. The general footprint located below the &#x003b1;2-1 helix of K<sup>b</sup> is supported by serological experiments whereby we determined whether CPXV203 competed with monoclonal antibodies specific for well-characterized epitopes.

CPXV203 promiscuously binds MHCI through a large, somewhat nonpolar interface divided into three distinct contact regions (&#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3, and &#x003b2;2m domains) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001432-g005">Figures 5A, 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001432.s004">S4A, S4B</xref>). The arrangement of these contact regions is only available in fully assembled MHCI, and as such CPXV203 binds MHCI in an assembly-dependent manner that is peptide-independent as long as MHCI assembly is also peptide-independent, as is the case for TL. Comparison of the CPXV203/MHCI interface to similar interfaces reveals that the total buried surface area (BSA) is significantly larger than most other complexes, CPXV203 buries &#x0003e;200 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> more main-chain (MC) than any similar MHCI-binder, and only CPXV203 divides its interface nearly equally among the platform (&#x003b1;1/&#x003b1;2), &#x003b2;2m, and &#x003b1;3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001432-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001432.s009">Table S5</xref>). CPXV203 recognizes MHCI elements that are extremely well conserved in all murine pMHCI: overall, 86%; CPXV203 contacts, 91%; CPXV203 side chain (SC) contacts, 95%; five invariant SC contacts. Further, CPXV203 recognizes core structural features of the MHCI fold by anchoring each of the three domain interfaces through a buried MC-MC hydrogen bond and two to three MC-SC hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001432.s004">Figure S4C</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001432.s004">S4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001432.s008">Table S4</xref>). Through these contacts, CPXV203 recognizes seven backbone positions conserved by the MHCI fold and coordinates conserved MHCI side chains within the &#x003b1;3 interface (Q226, D227, E229) also required for Tpn and CD8 association <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Kern1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Further, the presence of CPXV203 His residues opposite negatively charged &#x003b1;3 domain residues (H75-D227, H80-E229) suggests these may be pH-regulated interactions, though only H80-E229 is close enough to form a direct contact (3.5 &#x000c5; versus 7.3 &#x000c5;). Finally, we have identified that CPXV203 downregulates the non-classical MHCI molecule H2-M3, while mCD1d escapes CPXV203 retrieval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001432.s004">Figure S4F, S4G</xref>). Our structural results support the idea that escape by mCD1d is facilitated in part by a charge reversal at position 229 (mCD1d H233 &#x02013; CPXV203 H80) and the orientation of mCD1d Q230 away from the interface due to an altered CD-loop conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001432.s004">Figure S4H</xref>). This structural investigation explains promiscuous MHCI retrieval by CPXV203, as it specifically targets a tri-domain interface of evolutionarily conserved contacts that would only be presented by fully assembled MHCI.</p><fig id="pbio-1001432-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1001432.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>CPXV203 binds conserved elements within each MHCI domain.</title><p>The CPXV203/MHCI complex is shown as a Connolly surface (1.4 &#x000c5; probe).

Thus, CPXV203 exploits a cellular pathway to target MHCI surfaces critical for immunological function in a manner that selects for those MHCI molecules most likely to present viral peptides.</p><fig id="pbio-1001432-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1001432.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>CPXV203 co-opts the KDELR to retrieve MHCI from the Golgi.</title><p>Comparison of the separate but complementary strategies employed by CPXV012 and CPXV203 to downregulate MHCI.

To our knowledge, CPXV203 is the first member of the large T4 poxvirus protein family <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Barry1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> to be structurally characterized, suggesting a previously underappreciated link between the poxvirus CKBPs and T4 protein families through similarities in their &#x003b2;-sandwich core. Regardless of the evolutionary history, the adaptation of this protein domain to structurally distinct ligands and unrelated functional outcomes suggests the integral role that CPXV203 plays in antigen presentation disruption may not be its only function.</p><p>CPXV203 evolved into a promiscuous MHCI-binding protein by targeting MHCI determinants that are largely conserved by virtue of their roles in the recognition by host factors essential to cellular immunity (Tpn, CD8, NKRs). For instance, many &#x003b1;2-domain contacts (R111, Q115, E128, T134) are conserved through Tpn (&#x003b1;2 128&#x02013;136) <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and Ly49 (R111, Q115, D122) <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> interactions, while the &#x003b2;2m contacts primarily involve structurally conserved backbone positions within the LIR-1/MHCI interface <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Willcox1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.

Unlike other amino acids, histidine is well suited to serve this function, as small pH shifts can drastically change the charge and hydrogen-bonding potential of this residue. As such, our investigation of CPXV203/MHCI pH regulation focused on interface histidines, which revealed a significant contribution of CPXV203 H75 and H80 to complex half-life at low pH. We suggest that these titratable His residues endow CPXV203 with the ability to regulate fully assembled MHCI in a manner that is complementary to the regulation of PLC-associated MHCI by CPXV012.</p><p>The specific binding of CPXV203 to fully assembled MHCI proteins in a pH-dependent manner clarifies mechanistically how CPXV203 coordinates with CPXV012 to effectively block antigen presentation. Previous characterizations showed the CPXV012 functions in a PLC-dependent fashion to block TAP transport of peptide into the ER <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Byun2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Alzhanova1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, some MHCI-binding peptides in the ER are not TAP-dependent and the CPXV012 block of peptide transport is likely not absolute. The MHCI proteins that are able to bind peptide in the presence of CPXV012 are left to CPXV203, since it binds fully assembled MHCI through domain-specific conformational determinants conserved in classical and many non-classical MHCI. Among these interactions, the &#x003b1;3 interface is particularly important based on the presence of CPXV203 His residues that impart pH regulation to the CPXV203/MHCI interaction. This pH dependence suggests that CPXV203/MHCI interacts most avidly in the Golgi and not the ER, thus limiting the pool of MHCI that CPXV203 must retrieve.</p><p>Interestingly, CRT has a C-terminal KDEL sequence conferring ER retrieval, and non-PLC-associated CRT has recently been implicated in quality control of MHCI peptide loading <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Howe1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. More specifically, CRT was shown to accumulate in the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi and return peptide accessible MHCI proteins to the ER. Both CRT and CPXV203 retrieve MHCI proteins but with opposite goals. CRT functions in host quality control by retrieving MHCI with suboptimal peptides, whereas CPXV203 functions in immune evasion by retrieving fully assembled MHCI to block antigen presentation. Thus CPXV012 and -203 act sequentially to efficiently block MHCI expression using PLC-dependent versus PLC-independent mechanisms, respectively. As a possible consequence of efficient MHCI downregulation resulting in NK cell susceptibility, CPXV expresses the soluble class I-like protein OMCP that functions as a competitive antagonist of the NKG2D-activating receptor <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Indeed, the combined sabotage of both CTL and NK cell detection of virus-infected cells explains why mutant CPXV lacking CPXV012 and 203 demonstrates attenuated virulence in vivo compared to wild-type virus <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Byun2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies</title><p>MHCI-specific MAbs used in SPR competition assays were obtained from the ATCC (H-2K<sup>b</sup>: 25-D1.1.6, B8-24-3, Y-3), purchased from BioLegend (K<sup>b</sup>: AF6-88.5.3, K<sup>b</sup>/D<sup>b</sup>: 28-8-6, K<sup>d</sup>/D<sup>d</sup>: 34-1-2S, h&#x003b2;2m: 2M2), or provided as a kind gift (K<sup>b</sup>: 5F1-2-14) from S.

The complexes are shown using the same representation, color scheme, and orientation as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001432-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. All topological differences between CKBPs and CPXV203 are listed.

<bold>CPXV203/MHCI interface analysis.</bold> (A,B) Sequence alignment of MHCI regions contacted by CPXV203. MHCI 2<sup>o</sup> structure, Tpn/CD8/NKR contacts, and side chain solvent accessibility are shown above the alignments (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001432.s003">Figure S3</xref> for additional alignment details). CPXV203/MHCI contacts are boxed in magenta, while MHCI backbone contacts are indicated with an asterisk above the alignment. (A) MHCI HC were included in this alignment if they are downregulated or bound by CPXV203. Murine CD1d was identified as a null allele in this study (see G), and so it is shown below the other alleles to highlight the lack of sequence conservation in CPXV203/MHCI contact regions. D227 and E229 are indicated with blue/red circles, as CPXV203 H75 and H80 are believed to contact these Tpn contact residues in a pH-regulated manner. (B) &#x003b2;2m sequences of potential poxvirus hosts are shown (primate, rodent, livestock). Tpn contacts are based on published mutagenesis work <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Lehner1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Horst1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, while HBPLUS was used to identify CD8 and NKR contacts from all available complex structures (CD8/MHCI: 1AKJ, 1BQH, 1NEZ, 3DMM; Ly49/MHCI: 1QO3, 3C8K; LIR/MHCI: 1P7Q, 2DYP) <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Wiertz1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. (C&#x02013;E) The CPXV203/MHCI complex is shown using stick representation with each interface colored by chain (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001432-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and element (C, blue/grey/magenta; O, red; N, dark blue). Side-chains are shown for all contact residues, and MHCI backbone contacts are indicated (*). Residues that appear to be involved in putative hydrogen-bond networks (interface contacts: yellow dots; potential &#x003b2;5&#x02013;&#x003b2;6 loop conformation stabilizers: grey dots) are labeled. Interface views were rotated (relative to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001432-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) for optimal viewing: C 10&#x000b0; (y); D 90&#x000b0; (y); E &#x0223c;90&#x000b0; (x), &#x0223c;150&#x000b0; (z). (C) CPXV203 contacts the underside of the MHCI peptide-binding platform (&#x003b1;1/&#x003b1;2) through burial of large hydrophobic residues (I160 and Y161) immediately following helix-5 (h5). (D) Parallel CPXV203 histidines from &#x003b2;-sheets I and II coordinate &#x003b2;2m backbone carbonyl oxygens. The &#x003b2;2m interface MC-MC hydrogen bond is above the shown view. (E) CPXV203 extensively interacts with conserved MHCI residues Q226 and E229. CPXV203 H75 and H80 are directly opposite conserved, acidic MHCI residues D227 and E229. (F,G) CPXV203 is able to downregulate MHC Ia and Ib molecules but not mCD1d. WT3 cells were transduced with either vector or CPXV203-IRES-GFP and then MHCI surface expression was monitored by flow-cytometry. (F) For H2-M3 expression, cells were incubated with 20 &#x000b5;M Fr38 (fFMIVIL) peptide from <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> at 37&#x000b0;C over night (18 h) before staining by MAb 130, as previously described <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Burgert1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. CPXV203 downregulated both the Ia (H-2K<sup>b</sup>) and Ib (H2-M3) molecules. Similar studies revealed that H-2K<sup>k</sup> (Ia) and MR1 (Ib) are both susceptible to CPXV203-mediated downregulation (data not shown). (G) Extension of the studies to L929-CD1d cells (H-2k) revealed that CPXV203 was not able to downregulate the Ib molecule CD1d, while the Ia molecule H-2D<sup>k</sup> was efficiently downregulated. SPR and BLI studies at pH<sub>ER</sub> and pH<sub>Golgi</sub> also confirmed mCD1d as a null allele (unpublished data). (H) Comparison of MHCI crystal structures clearly shows conservation of the &#x003b1;3 loop conformation with the exception of CD1d. The &#x003b1;3 domains (181&#x02013;274) of numerous MHCI structures (murine and human, Ia and Ib) were aligned by combinatorial extension. A subset of those structures is shown here (PDBs 1VAC, 1P7Q, 3ILP) <xref rid="pbio.1001432-Pbo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Machold1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001432-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1001432.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1001432.s005"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
