The <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> genus comprises fungal species that are pathogenic for a wide range of crop species worldwide. To investigate the role of RNA silencing in the ascomycete fungus <italic>Colletotrichum higginsianum</italic>, knock-out mutants affecting genes for three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), two Dicer-like (DCL), and two Argonaute (AGO) proteins were generated by targeted gene replacement.

<italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. comprises a diverse group of fungal pathogens that attack over 3000 plant species worldwide. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern fungal development and pathogenicity may enable more effective and sustainable approaches to crop disease management and control. In most organisms, RNA silencing is an important mechanism to control endogenous and exogenous RNA. RNA silencing utilizes small regulatory molecules (small RNAs) produced by proteins called Dicer (DCL), and exercise their function though effector proteins named Argonaute (AGO). Here, we investigated the role of RNA silencing machinery in the fungus <italic>Colletotrichum higginsianum</italic>, by generating deletions in genes encoding RNA silencing components. Severe defects were observed in both conidiation and conidia morphology in the &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic>, and &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> strains. Analysis of transcripts and small RNAs revealed an uncharacterized dsRNA virus persistently infecting <italic>C</italic>. <italic>higginsianum</italic>. The virus was shown (1) to be de-repressed in the &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> strains, and (2) to cause the conidiation and spore mutant phenotypes. Our results indicate that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>higginsianum</italic> employs RNA silencing as an antiviral mechanism to suppress viruses and their debilitating effects.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2010-IOF-273512</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Campo</surname><given-names>Sonia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI043288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carrington</surname><given-names>James C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1330562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carrington</surname><given-names>James C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (US)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-092287</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>SC was supported by a Marie Curie fellowship (FP7-PEOPLE-2010-IOF-273512).

Although pathways have proliferated and specialized in various lineages, a core RNA silencing mechanism is conserved among plants, animals, fungi and other eukaryotes [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Canonical RNA silencing involves highly base-paired or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is processed into 21&#x02013;30-nucleotide small RNAs by the activity of one or more ribonucleaseIII-like enzymes called Dicer or Dicer-like (DCL) [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Small RNAs are incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that contains a member of the Argonaute (AGO) protein family [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The small RNA programs the complex to recognize target RNA(s) through base pair complementarity, while the AGO protein functions as an effector to modulate the abundance or activity of the target [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The fungal kingdom comprises an enormous, diverse group of organisms. Two major fungal RNA silencing pathways have been described: the quelling and the meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD) pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both appear to be effective genome defense mechanisms that operate during asexual (quelling) [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and sexual development (MSUD) [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Fungal RNA silencing pathways function in genome protection and have been proposed to be involved in pathogenicity [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], development [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and antiviral defense [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Fungal viruses, or mycoviruses, are widespread. Most characterized mycoviruses have dsRNA genomes packaged in spherical particles (<italic>Totiviridae</italic>, <italic>Partititiviridae</italic>, <italic>Chrysoviridae</italic>) or a (+)single stranded (ssRNA) genome without the ability to form particles (<italic>Hypoviridae</italic>, <italic>Endornaviridae</italic>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Mycoviruses do not have an extracellular phase, but rather are transmitted vertically by spores or horizontally by hyphal anastomosis [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although mycoviral infections are generally associated with cryptic (non-symptomatic) and latent (expressed under specific conditions) infections, some mycoviruses cause debilitating phenotypes in their host, making mycoviruses a potential tool for the control of fungal plant pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In other cases, mycoviruses have coevolved mutualistically with their hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. <italic>Cryphonectria parasitica</italic> is a model filamentous fungus for the study of virus-host interactions [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and provided the first example that RNA silencing functions as an antiviral defence mechanism in fungi [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> has four RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases, two Dicer, and four Argonaute genes, but only <italic>dcl-2</italic> and <italic>agl-2</italic> have been shown to have roles in antiviral defense [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Genetic studies have revealed that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> antiviral defense is active against members from the <italic>Hypoviridae</italic>, <italic>Reoviridae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], <italic>Partitiviridae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], <italic>Totiviridae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and <italic>Megabirnaviridae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] families. Indirect evidence of an RNA silencing-mycovirus interaction has also been described in fungi with killer viruses. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the M satellites of the dsRNA mycovirus L-A from the <italic>Totiviridae</italic> family produce a toxin that kills uninfected neighbour cells but renders the host immune to the toxin [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Strains with active RNA silencing suppress the virus and lose the advantage provided by the virus [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The incompatibility between the killer virus and the RNA silencing machinery might explain the existence of several RNA silencing-deficient fungi [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The genus <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> is considered one of the most economically important groups of plant pathogens, causing anthracnose disease in over 3,200 species of monocot and dicot plants [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with some infections leading to post-harvest losses of up to 100%. <italic>Colletotrichum higginsianum</italic> infects plants of the <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> family, including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and is emerging as a model for the study of plant-pathogen interactions in dicotyledonous species [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>higginsianum</italic> is a hemibiotrophic fungus that forms an intracellular hyphae during the initial symptomless biotrophic stage before entering a destructive necrotrophic colonization phase. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>higginsianum</italic> has a relatively small haploid genome that was recently sequenced, the ability to be cultured axenically, and stable transformation methods that allow for the analysis of gene function by targeted disruption [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The primary goal of this study was to identify and analyze the role of the RNA silencing machinery in the fungal pathogen <italic>C</italic>. <italic>higginsianum</italic>.

As ScV-L-A capsid protein sequence is ~2X longer than ORF1 (608 aa versus 324 aa), it was expected that a large part of the ScV-L-A capsid sequence would not have homologous regions in ORF1. Indeed, ORF1 is structurally similar to only the N-terminal 414 aa of ScV-L-A. This N-terminal region is enriched with alpha helices (56%) compared to full length ScV-L-A (38%) while the C-terminal end, which is not found in ORF1, is enriched in beta sheets (C-terminus: 86%, entire sequence: 63%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005640.s012">S9 Fig</xref>).

Due to the significant increase in ChNRV1 levels observed in the &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> RNA-seq dataset, we hypothesized that viral small RNA production may be lower in the &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> strains. However, a significant increase in viral small RNAs was observed the &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> mutant strain relative to the controls, with 234,333 more reads present in &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) (95% confidence interval: 174,481 to 294,185). This result indicates that AGO1 is not required for production of ChNRV1-derived small RNAs, and that in the absence of AGO1, ChNRV1 was not adequately targeted for suppression. Further, the abundant production of small RNAs in &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> demonstrated that DICER activity alone is insufficient for controlling viral infection, a result also observed in an <italic>ago1/ago2</italic> double mutant of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> where DCL4 activity alone was insufficient for controlling viral infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005640.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. We further hypothesized that without DCL1, viral small RNAs would be significantly under-represented. However, ChNRV1-derived small RNAs were significantly over-represented in &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic> relative to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) (89,571 more reads; 95% confidence interval: 29,719 to 149,423), while levels in the &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic> strain were not significantly different than the controls.</p><p>To address the unexpected results for the &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic> samples we examined the ratio of sense to antisense small RNAs from the viral genome, hypothesizing that if the sequences observed in these samples were true small RNAs, this ratio would remain unchanged relative to the controls. A clear strand bias was not observed in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>higginsianum</italic> control strains (1.48 sense to antisense), indicating that viral small RNAs originate from both sense and antisense strands in an RNA silencing-proficient strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). The ratio of sense to antisense reads in all the <italic>rdr</italic> and <italic>ago</italic> mutants, as well as &#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic> strain, was indistinguishable from the controls. Further, while the total number of viral small RNAs significantly increased in &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic>, the relative ratio of sense to antisense reads was maintained, indicating that DCL action remained capable of generating viral small RNAs in the absence of AGO1. However, the average ratio of sense to antisense small RNAs in &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic> strains was 3.7 and 9.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), where the higher ratios are due to an increase in the number of reads from the sense strand (data available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8</xref> dataset). As this ratio was only partially perturbed in the &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic> strain, possibly DCL2 activity is capable of producing antisense viral small RNAs in the absence of DCL1; the loss of both DCLs results in primarily sense strand small RNA sequences with low representation from the antisense strand.</p><p>To further characterize the nature of ChNRV1-derived small RNAs, particularly those in the DCL1-deficient strains, we did a routine analysis of small RNAs by size and 5&#x02019; nucleotide preference. An initial analysis of the small RNAs by size did not reveal a pattern responsive to the loss of <italic>DCL1</italic> (data available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8</xref> dataset). Thus, viral small RNAs were split by strand and then plotted by size, reasoning that the antisense strand reads would convey the size profile of true viral small RNAs, while the signal on the plus strand may be contaminated with viral mRNA degradation products. The size distribution of ChNRV1 sense strand small RNAs was broad (20&#x02013;24 nt) and largely unaffected by genotype (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005640.s016">S13A</xref>). In particularly the size distribution by strand for the &#x00394;<italic>ago2</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic>, and all <italic>rdr</italic> mutant strains was indistinguishable from the controls, with peak abundance at 21 nt on the antisense strand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005640.s016">S13A Fig</xref>). Analysis of antisense strand small RNAs in the &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> strain also demonstrates a peak at 21 nt, along with a slight increase in abundance of longer (&#x02265;23 nt) small RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). A more pronounced shift in size is observed in the two strains lacking <italic>DCL1</italic>, where 21 nt sequences are depleted and those &#x02265; 23 nt are more abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). This suggests that despite the presence of antisense small RNAs in the &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic> strains, there was a loss in size-specificity expected of DICER-dependent small RNAs. A Northern blot analysis of visRNAs from &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic>, and wild-type confirmed three key aspects of the sequencing analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005640.s015">S12B Fig</xref>). First, viral small RNAs in &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> are more abundant than in wild-type, and that there is a size specificity of ~22 nt. Secondly, the signal in the &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic> lanes was diffuse and lacked the specific accumulation of visRNAs observed in the &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> strains. Finally, no signal from ChNRV1 small RNAs was detected in the &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic> or wild-type lanes indicating that accumulation in these strains was demonstrably lower than observed in the &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> strains, and indeed, below the threshold for detection via blot under these experimental conditions.</p><p>ChNRV1-derived small RNAs from the control strains had a preference for 5&#x02019; U, which was negatively affected in the &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic>, and &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8E</xref>), but not in the remaining RNA silencing mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005640.s016">S13B Fig</xref>). In &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> less than 50% of reads had a 5&#x02019;U compared to 75% in the controls, suggesting that AGO1 binds to and stabilizes viral small RNAs with a 5&#x02019;U. Similarly, loss of DCL1 affected the 5&#x02019; nucleotide distribution of ChNRV1 small RNAs, where only 25% of reads contained a 5&#x02019;U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). Thus, size and nucleotide analyses indicate that in strains with an intact AGO1 and DCL1, ChNRV1-derived small RNAs are 21-nt in length with a 5&#x02019;U.</p><p>To better understand viral small RNA production, particularly in the &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic> strains, we measured the abundance of ChNRV1-derived small RNAs relative to the ChNRV1 RNA-seq data. Each replicate of small RNA for each genotype shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8B</xref> was divided by the average number of RNA-seq reads of the corresponding strain (data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). The average ratio of small RNAs to RNA-seq in the controls was 23.33, which was not significantly different from that of the <italic>rdr</italic>, <italic>dcl2</italic>, and <italic>ago2</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). The ratio observed in &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> was significantly lower at 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 4.0 to 34.1), meaning that small RNA production from ChNRV1, as a function of the RNA-seq data, was approximately 22 times lower in &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8F</xref>), further indicating that the abundant levels of ChNRV1 small RNAs produced by DCL1 are not sufficient for controlling viral RNA levels; AGO1 is also required. As with &#x00394;<italic>ago1</italic>, the small RNA to RNA-seq ratios observed in &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic> decreased to a mean of 0.28 and 0.06, respectively (95% confidence intervals: 4.6 to 34.7 and 4.8 to 34.9). Visualizing the distribution of small RNAs along the viral genome, again controlling for RNA-seq levels, illustrates that particular loci from both strands appeared to be hot spots for ChNRV1-derived small RNA production in strains with a functioning DCL1 and AGO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8G</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that DCL1 is the primary producer of viral small RNAs as the strains lacking this gene have altered size and 5&#x02019; nucleotide distributions relative to RNA silencing-proficient strains. Further, AGO1 is also a crucial member of the antiviral defense as DCL1 activity alone was inadequate for controlling ChNRV1 transcript levels.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Small RNAs derived from ChNRV1 are loaded into AGO1</title><p>ChNRV1-derived small RNAs were further characterized by the analysis of AGO immunoprecipitate fractions. A comparison of unique sequences in the 6H3F-AGO2 IP and WT/mock IP revealed a high degree of correlation between these samples (average Pearson correlation co-efficient (&#x003c1;) = 0.96) that was not observed between 6H3F-AGO1 IP and WT/mock IP (average &#x003c1; = 0.67). Combined with the nearly undetectable levels of AGO2 RNA and protein, suggested that AGO2 does not play a major role in RNA silencing during vegetative growth. As such, we focused all further analyses on the 6H3F-AGO1 input and IP samples only. As expected, we observed ChNRV1-derived small RNAs in both the AGO1 input and IP fractions upon alignment to the expanded genome sequence (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">8H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005640.s014">S11C</xref>, right panel), and these sequences represented the majority of newly mapping reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005640.s014">S11D Fig</xref>). ChNRV1-derived small RNAs were significantly more abundant in the 6H3F-AGO1 IP than the input, where we observed 186,362 more reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8I</xref>) (95% confidence interval: 158,030 to 214,693). Analysis of 6H3F-AGO1-bound small RNAs by strand revealed an average ratio of 1.3 sense to antisense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8J</xref>), indicating that viral small RNAs loaded into AGO1 originated from both strands without a strong bias. A size distribution analysis determined that 21 nt was the predominant size in the 6H3F-AGO1 IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8K</xref>), and a 5&#x02019; nucleotide preference for 6H3F-AGO1-bound small RNAs was clear as nearly 99% of viral small RNAs loaded into AGO1 had a 5&#x02019;U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8L</xref>). The strong 5&#x02019; nucleotide preference of AGO1 further demonstrates that the sequences observed in the &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>dcl1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcl2</italic> datasets are not likely to be functional as these small RNAs are not the preferred substrate to be loaded into AGO1 for targeting the viral genome. 6H3F-AGO1-bound viral small RNAs originated from both strands and were distributed across the ChNRV1 genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8M</xref>). Regions with the greatest signal in the 6H3F-AGO1 IP corresponded to the hotspots observed in the controls and mutant strains proficient at silencing ChNRV1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005640.g008">Fig 8G</xref>), suggesting that small RNAs from these loci were specifically being loaded into AGO1.</p><p>Here we used RNA-seq and small RNA datasets from high-throughput sequencing to characterize the antiviral role of RNA silencing machinery in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>higginsianum</italic>.
