Highly pathogenic influenza virus infections generally coincide with early, high levels of inflammatory cytokines that some studies have suggested may be regulated in a strain-dependent manner. However, a comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamics of the inflammatory response induced by virulent influenza strains is lacking. Here, we applied gene co-expression and nonlinear regression analysis to time-course, microarray data developed from influenza-infected mouse lung to create mathematical models of the host inflammatory response. We found that the dynamics of inflammation-associated gene expression are regulated by an ultrasensitive-like mechanism in which low levels of virus induce minimal gene expression but expression is strongly induced once a threshold virus titer is exceeded. Cytokine assays confirmed that the production of several key inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, exhibit ultrasensitive behavior. A systematic exploration of the pathways regulating the inflammatory-associated gene response suggests that the molecular origins of this ultrasensitive response mechanism lie within the branch of the Toll-like receptor pathway that regulates STAT1 phosphorylation. This study provides the first evidence of an ultrasensitive mechanism regulating influenza virus-induced inflammation in whole lungs and provides insight into how different virus strains can induce distinct temporal inflammation response profiles. The approach developed here should facilitate the construction of gene regulatory models of other infectious diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Vaccines suffice for protecting public health against seasonal influenza viruses, but when unexpected strains appear against which the vaccine does not confer protection, alternative treatments are necessary. In this work, we used gene expression and virus growth data from influenza-infected mice to determine how moderate and deadly influenza viruses may invoke unique inflammatory responses and the role these responses play in disease pathology. We found that the relationship between virus growth and the inflammatory response for all viruses tested can be characterized by ultrasensitive response in which the inflammatory response is gated until a threshold concentration of virus is exceeded in the lung after which strong inflammatory gene expression and cytokine production occurs. This finding challenges the notion that deadly influenza viruses invoke unique cytokine and inflammatory responses and provides additional evidence that pathology is regulated by virus load, albeit in a highly nonlinear fashion. These findings suggests immunomodulatory treatments could focus on altering inflammatory response dynamics to improve disease pathology.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency&#x02019;s Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO) program and Strategic Basic Research Programs.

PRR ligation triggers innate immune responses and leads to the induction of inflammatory and antiviral gene expression, which together function to limit pathogen growth, activate the adaptive immune response, and ultimately resolve the infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Precise regulation of PRR-mediated signaling is necessary to both avoid inadvertent tissue damage in response to non-pathogenic stimuli, and to prevent immunopathology resulting from excessive expression of inflammatory molecules. In essence, the ideal inflammatory response must exhibit a balance between appropriate activation against a genuine threat and self-limiting behavior once that threat has been controlled. Despite its importance in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis and limiting pathogen-associated diseases, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of this balance are poorly understood.</p><p>Influenza A viruses are recognized by both TLRs and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and some strains are potent inducers of inflammatory and antiviral gene expression. Generally, lung tissues infected with pathogenic isolates exhibit high virus titers and robust inflammatory gene expression, as has been documented in <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with the 1918 Spanish influenza virus [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast, seasonal influenza viruses typically replicate less efficiently, elicit more restrained inflammatory responses, and are usually not associated with lethal infections. Recent evidence has implicated the level of virus replication in infected lung tissues as the primary phenotypic variable driving inflammation and lethal outcomes [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Other data indicate that influenza viruses that exhibit significant differences in pathogenicity stimulate qualitatively similar host responses that differ primarily at the level of magnitude and kinetics [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, these studies have not revealed the mechanisms that account for the different profile dynamics observed in infections by high and low pathogenic viruses. Such information would aid in clarifying not only how some influenza viruses induce lethal disease, but also the general mechanisms that regulate inflammatory balance.</p><p>To characterize the dynamics of influenza virus-induced inflammation, we developed a novel approach to infer gene regulatory models from dynamic gene expression data. Referred to as systems inference microarray analysis, our method builds on current approaches that use co-expression analysis to isolate modules of functional signatures in gene expression data and then extends these methods by fitting the gene expression modules to mathematical equations (models) by using segmented regression analysis. Models can be created to look for strain-dependent responses and, unlike traditional differential expression analysis, to predict gene expression under new experimental conditions. By using this method, we set out to determine how influenza viruses that exhibit variable pathogenicity profiles influence the dynamics of the inflammatory response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>H1N1, pH1N1, and H5N1 have distinct virulence and growth dynamics</title><p>To characterize the dynamics of the host immune response to specific virus isolates, we infected mice with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of three virus isolates with distinct pathogenicity profiles and harvested lung tissues at 14 time points after infection (from 0 to 7 days post-infection; n = 3 per virus per time point; see <xref rid="ppat.1004856.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) for several parallel analyses. These viruses included a low pathogenicity seasonal H1N1 influenza virus (A/Kawasaki/UTK4/2009 [H1N1]; referred to as &#x02018;H1N1&#x02019;), a mildly pathogenic virus from the 2009 pandemic season (A/California/04/2009 [H1N1]; referred to as &#x02018;pH1N1&#x02019;), and a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 [H5N1]; referred to as &#x02018;H5N1&#x02019;). An initial inoculation of 10<sup>5</sup> PFU was used as previous studies indicated that a high virus dose was needed to invoke different pathologies in H1N1 and pH1N1-infected mice [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As expected, lung virus titers (virus titers determined by plaque assay and reported in plaque forming units [PFU] per gram lung; <xref rid="ppat.1004856.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) indicated a clear hierarchy of mild, moderate, and severe virus-induced disease. Specifically, the H5N1 virus produced the highest lung titers and between days 5 and 7 post-infection, this virus also caused mortality in the animals whose lungs were to be collected on day 7 post-infection (i.e., &#x02018;severe&#x02019; disease). In contrast, all animals infected with the H1N1 or pH1N1 viruses survived the duration of the time course study; however, pH1N1-infected animals were visibly sicker and exhibited higher lung titers relative to those infected with H1N1 at all time points observed after the first 30 h post-infection (i.e., &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; and &#x02018;mild&#x02019; disease, respectively). Histopathological analysis of tissue samples collected on days 1, 2, and 5 post-infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) also showed that H5N1-infected tissue exhibited the earliest, most severe signs of inflammation and inflammatory immune cell infiltrates followed by pH1N1-infected tissue, whereas H1N1-infected tissue showed mild evidence of inflammation and was most similar to tissue from the control mice (mock-infected mice).</p><fig id="ppat.1004856.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1004856.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Virus growth dynamics.</title><p>Mice were infected with 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of H1N1, pH1N1, or H5N1 virus, three mice per infection group were euthanized at 14 time points after infection (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, and 60 h and 3, 5, and 7 days), and virus titers in lung tissues were determined by plaque assays in MDCK cells.

We first asked whether the expression of inflammation-associated genes clustered into modules of co-expressed genes. Tissues from the same animals that were used to determine virus growth were used to evaluate changes in global lung transcriptional profiles. A total of 168 microarrays were developed (three per time point for H1N1-infected, pH1N1-infected, H5N1-infected and control mice). One microarray was removed after reviewing replicate quality. After filtering transcripts for minimally confident variation (we required at least one time-matched, infected condition compared with mock-infected absolute fold change &#x02265; 2 and a false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.01), the log<sub>2</sub> of the normalized intensity of the retained transcripts (16,063) for all 167 samples were then clustered by using the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) algorithm [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

To identify the biological role of the host response modules, we performed functional enrichment analysis on each gene module by using DAVID [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and ToppCluster [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Because each module was comprised of positively and negatively correlated transcripts, we used the module eigengene (i.e., the first principle component of the gene expression matrix) to divide each module into two submodules containing transcripts that were positively or negatively correlated with the parent module&#x02019;s eigengene, denoted as kME+ and kME- (referred to as module membership), respectively. This procedure allowed us to look for biological processes with similar but opposing dynamic responses to the virus infections. Functional enrichment analyses were then applied to each submodule by using two bioformatics platforms to ensure robust results.</p><p>We identified two submodules (N1 kME+ and N2 kME-, referred to as simply N1 and N2 in the remainder of the text) that were enriched for inflammatory response and inflammation-associated pathway signatures by using both bioinformatics platforms, and these two modules became the focus of our study (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the functional enrichment results for the immune and inflammatory related annotations.

Exudate macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and neutrophil [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] have been identified as factors of severe disease during influenza infection. To associate gene expression dynamics with changes of immune cell counts, a new population of mice were infected with the three influenza viruses, five mice per infection group were sacrificed on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 and the changes in the number of macrophages and neutrophils was assessed (see <xref rid="sec010" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Unlike the previous study by Brandes, <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], strong neutrophil infiltration was not specific to fatal infections but, instead, infiltration of both cell types had a clear hierarchical relationship with the severity of the infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). The N2 module eigengene exhibited a lesser correlation to virus titer (&#x003c1; = 0.55), but was tightly correlated to macrophage influx into the lung (&#x003c1; = 0.90; <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.01 Student&#x02019;s t-test). Of the 45 module identified in the studied, N2 had the highest correlation to both macrophage and neutrophil influx (the correlation of macrophage and neutrophil influx and all 45 module eigengenes are provided in <xref rid="ppat.1004856.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>; &#x003c1; = 0.80; <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.01).

We also observed that interferon stimulated genes tended to have higher intramodular hub rankings, suggesting a regulatory role for interferon (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02013;12</sup>). We then considered the module membership rankings of transcription factors known to regulate interferon. Of the established interferon regulatory factors that are members of the N1 module (e.g., <italic>Irf1</italic>, <italic>Irf2</italic>, <italic>Irf7</italic>, <italic>Irf9</italic>, <italic>Stat1</italic>, and <italic>Stat2</italic>. <italic>Nfkb1</italic> and <italic>Nfkb2</italic> were not assigned to N1), <italic>Irf1</italic> and <italic>Irf7</italic> had the highest module memberships (kME = 0.94 and 0.93; ranking = 118 and 225, respectively). <italic>Irf7</italic> expression was also several orders of magnitude greater than <italic>Irf1</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>).

For this reason, we sought to further explore the possibility of isolate-specific or isolate-independent response patterns of the cytokine-associated N1 module.

Following activation, N1 gene expression increased as a function of virus concentration at the same apparent rate for all infection conditions, and more complicated dynamics were observed only during the later phase of the infection when virus clearance was observed (i.e., when the virus titers began to decrease).

To formalize the hypothesis that the inflammatory gene response follows an ultrasensitive response profile, we selected a segmented linear model (SLM, defined in <xref rid="ppat.1004856.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>) to be a simplified representation of the ordinary differential equations normally used to model ultrasensitive responses, and we fit the N1 SDE to an SLM that was strictly a function of the virus titer. The optimal fit showed a threshold of 10<sup>7.78&#x000b1;0.14</sup> PFU/g is required for N1 module activation to occur, after which the SDE&#x02019;s rate of activation (a<sub>2</sub>) was 0.5&#x000b1;0.07 log<sub>10</sub>(PFU/g)<sup>-1</sup> with an intercept (b<sub>2</sub>) of -3.8 (unitless) (see the <xref rid="sec010" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004856.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> for additional details). Below this threshold, the model predicted minimal gene expression (a1 = 0.17; b1 = 0.03). The SLM goodness of fit on the training data was an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72 while an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.41 was observed when the data was fit to a linear model. A Davie&#x02019;s test confirmed that a segmented model was a significantly better fit than a linear correlation model (<italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 2.2e-16). While the H1N1-infected lung tissue did not exceed an average peak virus titer of 10<sup>7.4</sup> PFU/g (peak titer occurs at 48 hpi in <xref rid="ppat.1004856.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), we observed increased transcriptional activity in H1N1-infected mouse lung tissues after this time point, suggesting either that the actual peak virus titer occurred between 48 hpi and the subsequent time point (60 hpi), or that the model-predicted threshold was slightly over-approximated.</p><p>We next sought to validate the threshold model by attempting to predict cytokine-associated gene expression in influenza virus-infected lung when only the virus titers are known. For this, we selected the H5N1 virus, which has previously been associated with an excessive cytokine response [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We infected mice with 10<sup>3</sup> PFU of the H5N1 virus (a 100-fold reduced dose compared with that used in the experiments to fit the model), determined lung virus titers at the same time points used for the initial experiment (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>), and then evaluated the segmented linear model&#x02019;s ability to predict cytokine-associated gene expression. First, we confirmed that the original transcripts assigned to the N1 module were again co-expressed, and thus we used the same transcripts originally assigned to the N1 module to determine the eigengene (see <xref rid="ppat.1004856.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref> for an analysis of the conservation of the N1 module between the two experiments). In this experiment, as expected, the peak average virus titer (10<sup>9.3&#x000b1;0.21</sup> PFU/g) for the 10<sup>3</sup> PFU dose was delayed compared with that for the 10<sup>5</sup> PFU dose (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>, compare to <xref rid="ppat.1004856.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Moreover, the SDE exhibited an 18-h delay in activation and a 42-h delay in peak expression compared with the 10<sup>5</sup> PFU N1 eigengene (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>).

In addition, when the protein expression levels of these 15 cytokines were plotted against the corresponding titer data, we observed dynamics similar to that of the inflammatory-associated N1 gene module. Initially, protein expression was low but strongly increased only after the virus titers exceeded the threshold of ~10<sup>8</sup> PFU/gram determined in the gene regulation model (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>).

The only major exceptions were LIF, RANTES, and IL18 (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). LIF&#x02019;s gene transcript was not annotated on the arrays whereas IL18&#x02019;s transcript was not identified as differentially expressed and therefore was not included in the clustering study. The RANTES transcript was included in the clustering study and assigned by the WGCNA algorithm to N2 although the transcript&#x02019;s correlation to the N1 eigengene suggests it could also have been assigned to the N1 module (Pearson correlation = 0.84 and 0.89 to the N1 and N2 eigengene, respectively). Some proteins appeared to conform to the threshold model in pH1N1-infected, but not H1N1- or H5N1-infected, mice. These may be cytokines that have strain-dependent responses and do not conform to the model. Overall, changes in N1-associated cytokine protein levels in influenza virus-infected mouse lungs were consistent with the proposed virus-titer regulated threshold-mechanism underlying the IFN-mediated response.</p><fig id="ppat.1004856.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1004856.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Threshold-like behavior is observed on upstream and downstream components of the IFN signaling pathway.</title><p>(a) Lung tissues from the same infected mice used for the original gene expression analysis were subjected to cytokine array analysis.

Significant increases in the concentration of IFN-&#x003b1; and phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) were detectable in infections with all three virus isolates and occurred at time points after the threshold level of virus was exceeded (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). For the H1N1 data, significant levels of pSTAT1 were observed at 36 hpi which&#x02014;as noted previously&#x02014;corresponds to the time immediately after the virus titers in H1N1-infected mice reached their peak (see previous discussion). On the other hand, significant increases in phosphorylated IRF3 (pIRF3) were observed only in pH1N1 and H5N1 infections, whereas significant increases in IFN-&#x003b2; were observed only in the H5N1 infection. Changes in the levels of IFN-&#x003b2; and pIRF3 occurred after significant increases in pSTAT1 and IFN-&#x003b1; occurred. As such, the change in the percentage of pSTAT1 was more closely correlated to the N1 eigengene than was that of pIRF3 (correlation = 0.77&#x000b1;0.06 and 0.67&#x000b1;0.09 respectively), and significant increases in pSTAT1 corresponded to time points at which the mean virus titer exceeded the threshold level identified in the gene expression analysis (~10<sup>7.78</sup> PFU/g).

The power of the threshold model is illustrated by its ability to accurately predict gene expression in infected mice, and the data further suggest that the molecular basis of threshold behavior originates upstream of IFN-&#x003b1; production. Threshold-like and ultrasensitive mechanisms are hypothesized to be necessary for effective management of critical cellular machinery in noisy environments, and are recognized players in the activation of the cell cycle [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and apoptosis [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, while a role for threshold behaviors have been postulated to be essential for filtering noise or errant signaling in complex biomolecular environments [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], our study is the first to directly link threshold-like behavior to the virus-induced innate immune response.</p><p>The ultrasensitive response observed in this study provides additional insight into the mechanisms that drive severe pathologies during influenza infection. Several works have suggested that viral load is a key determinant of pathology [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] while other works suggest that highly pathogenic influenza viruses induce early, strong inflammatory responses that are independent of the viral load [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Recently, it was observed that fatal influenza infections in mice coincide with a strong influx of neutrophils in what the author&#x02019;s describe as a viral load-independent, &#x0201c;feedforward&#x0201d; inflammatory circuit [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The ultrasensitive response suggested by our study consolidates these hypotheses by suggesting that viral load drives cytokine production (and in turn immune cell infiltration) in a nonlinear manner which is capable of producing states of high and low innate immune responses. Characterization of key aspects of the inflammatory response, such as the onset and peak inflammatory gene expression, require a high temporal resolution of the virus growth and host response dynamics; an experimental design that was unique to our study. The ultrasensitive response model does not negate the significance of neutrophil infiltration [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in determining fatal infections but suggests that viral load drives the high and low innate immune states. The observed threshold may represent the transition to immunopathology; as indicated by the histopathology results (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Moreover, the influenza virus&#x02019; NS1 protein is crucial for inhibiting the interferon-mediated antiviral response [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The NS1 protein of three viruses used in this study have the SUMO1 acceptor site that indicates interferon antagonism capability [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Additional studies with NS1-mutated viruses and other pathogens may better reveal strain-dependencies for the observed thresholding behavior.</p><p>The ultrasensitive response further suggests that the innate immune response has a limited capacity to respond to influenza virus infection and supports the development of immunomodulatory therapies. Interestingly, after the threshold was exceeded, the rate of activation for inflammatory and interferon-associated gene expression (N1) was conserved for a moderately pathogenic and deadly viruses (<xref rid="ppat.1004856.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). The conserved rate of activation implies that the immune response detects the virus concentration but not the virus growth rate; suggesting the innate immune response is naturally limited in its ability to respond to high growth influenza viruses. Additionally, studies in knockout mice indicate that type I IFN-associated pathways are essential for protection during primary infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and that earlier initiation of these pathways coincides with increased survival in mice infected with highly pathogenic isolates [<xref rid="ppat.1004856.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In combination with these studies, the findings here suggest a novel means of protecting high risk groups by treating them with compounds that target the molecular mechanisms responsible for the threshold behavior. Lowering the threshold required to induce the cytokine response may be a means of providing protection from severe influenza infection. Since these compounds would target host proteins, such treatments would be effective against various influenza virus strains. Data from the viruses studied here suggest that post-threshold, inflammatory gene expression primarily reflects interferon-regulated tissue damage, but time-course data from additional highly pathogenic viruses are needed to assess the degree to which interferon activity is associated with virus growth suppression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Viruses</title><p>The A/California/04/09 H1N1 virus (pH1N1) was received from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The scaled difference of the eigengene (SDE) is shown in (b). The SDE now represents the fraction of greatest gene expression (i.e., the fraction of the largest log fold change in gene expression observed between all time-matched, infected-to-control samples). For example, the SDE peaks in experimental condition 50 (H5N1-infected animals at 30 hpi), corresponding to the condition in which the log fold change was greatest for N1 member genes (see <xref rid="ppat.1004856.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The SDE for pH1N1-infected animals at day 3 pi (condition 40) is ~0.5. We would expect the log fold change to be approximately half of that observed in H5N1-infected animals at 30 hpi (see the heatmaps in <xref rid="ppat.1004856.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). For completeness, we overlay the mean (lines) and the standard deviation (shaded regions) of the SDE (see panel c) to replicate the results shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004856.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1004856.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1004856.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Segmented linear model training and performance.</title><p>To create the segmented linear model to describe the relationship between the N1 module eigengene and the virus titer data, we selected all titer data that occurred prior to and included the peak of the eigengene and then scaled the data such that the eigengene was bound between [0,1].
