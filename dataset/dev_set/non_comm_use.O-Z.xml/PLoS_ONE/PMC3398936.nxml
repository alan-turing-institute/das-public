A point mutation in the critical ligand-binding residues of sites I and II, however, reduced both the binding affinity and amylose helix disruption. This is the first molecular model for structure disruption of the amylose helix by a non-hydrolytic CBM21 member. <italic>Ro</italic>SBD apparently twists the helical amylose strands apart to expose more ligand surface for further SBD binding. Repeating the process triggers the relaxation and unwinding of amylose helices to generate thinner and shorter amylose fibrils, which are more susceptible to hydrolysis by glucoamylase. This model aids in understanding the natural roles of CBMs in protein-glycan interactions and contributes to potential molecular engineering of CBMs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Starch is the primary form of carbohydrate storage in plant tubers and seed endosperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041131-Buleon1">[1]</xref> and is comprised of 70&#x02013;80&#x00025; amylopectin, which has a compact, branched molecular structure, and amylose (20&#x02013;30&#x00025;), which has an extended conformation.
