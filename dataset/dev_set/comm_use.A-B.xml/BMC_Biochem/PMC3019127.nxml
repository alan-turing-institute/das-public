Several proteins become S-glutathionylated following exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in a variety of cellular systems. In yeast, when using a high initial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>dose, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was identified as the major target of S-glutathionylation which leads to reversible inactivation of the enzyme. GAPDH inactivation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>functions to reroute carbohydrate flux to produce NADPH. Here we report the effect of low regulatory H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>doses on GAPDH activity and expression in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A calibrated and controlled method of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>delivery - the steady-state titration - in which cells are exposed to constant, low, and known H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations, was used in this study. This technique, contrary to the common bolus addition, allows determining which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations trigger specific biological responses. This work shows that both in exponential- and stationary-phase cells, low regulatory H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations induce a large upregulation of catalase, a fingerprint of the cellular oxidative stress response, but GAPDH oxidation and the ensuing activity decrease are only observed at death-inducing high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>doses. GAPDH activity is constant upon incubation with sub-lethal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>doses, but in stationary-phase cells there is a differential response in the expression of the three GAPDH isoenzymes: Tdh1p is strongly upregulated while Tdh2p/Tdh3p are slightly downregulated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In yeast GAPDH activity is largely unresponsive to low to moderate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>doses. This points to a scenario where (a) cellular redoxins efficiently cope with levels of GAPDH oxidation induced by a vast range of sub-lethal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations, (b) inactivation of GAPDH cannot be considered a sensitive biomarker of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidation in vivo. Since GAPDH inactivation only occurs at cell death-inducing high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>doses, GAPDH-dependent rerouting of carbohydrate flux is probably important merely in pathophysiological situations. This work highlights the importance of studying H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress using concentrations closer to the physiological for determining the importance of protein oxidation phenomena in the regulation of cellular metabolism.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The preferential and reversible oxidation of specific cysteine residues present in enzymes, transcription factors and receptors has been proposed to be the major mechanism by which oxidants may integrate into cellular signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The sulfhydryl (SH) group of cysteine residues, especially when present in an environment that decreases its pKa, can be oxidized by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), the main cellular reactive oxygen species. The major product of the reaction between a protein cysteinyl thiol and hydrogen peroxide is a protein sulfenic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] that, unless in a shielded environment, is a transient intermediate that undergoes a range of secondary reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The protein sulfenic acid can form (a) mixed disulfides with low-molecular weight thiols, mainly glutathione (S-glutathionylation), (b) intramolecular disulfides when vicinal thiols are present, (c) intermolecular disulfides between proteins or (d) reversible condensation with an adjacent amide to form a sulfenylamide. All these oxidations are reversible and, therefore, provide a mechanism by which protein function may be controlled by changes in cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration. When the levels of oxidant exposure are higher further oxidation of cysteinyl sulfenic acids can occur, leading to the formation of cysteinyl sulfinic and sulfonic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which is considered largely irreversible <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, these higher levels of oxidative stress may often result in excessive disulfide bonding, and in the misfolding, aggregation, and degradation of proteins leading, eventually, to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a classic glycolytic enzyme that is active as a tetramer of identical 37 kDa subunits catalyzing the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-diphosphoglycerate by converting NAD<sup>+ </sup>to NADH. More recently, GAPDH emerged as a multifunctional protein with defined functions in numerous subcellular processes, namely a primary role in apoptosis and in a variety of critical nuclear pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) three related but not identical GAPDH enzymes with different specific activities are encoded by unlinked genes designated <italic>TDH1</italic>, <italic>TDH2 </italic>and <italic>TDH3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. None of the <italic>TDH </italic>genes are individually essential for cell viability, but a functional copy of either <italic>TDH2 </italic>or <italic>TDH3 </italic>is required since <italic>tdh2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>tdh3</italic>&#x00394; cells are not viable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Studies with mammalian cells have identified GAPDH as a target of oxidative modifications resulting in decreased activity following exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. GAPDH has an active-site cysteine residue which, following exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, can be oxidized to an intramolecular disulfide and cysteic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and also undergo S-glutathionylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>growing in exponential phase, GAPDH was also identified as a major target of S-glutathionylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and also carbonylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and a sharp decrease in its enzymatic activity was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] following exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In cell extracts exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>both Thdh2p and Thdh3p are S-glutathionylated, but in vivo only S-glutathionylation of Thd3p is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Studies of GAPDH inactivation and S-glutathionylation in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] have been performed in the exponential phase of growth using bolus additions of high doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>that cause high levels of cell death, and so it is difficult to assess the possible regulatory role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>on GAPDH activity by inducing reversible GAPDH thiol oxidation, including S-glutathionylation. Therefore, our main aim with this study was to establish in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cells at what levels, in the range of low to moderate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations, is H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>able to cause an inhibition of GAPDH activity due to reversible and irreversible oxidation of the enzyme. To achieve this, instead of the typical H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>bolus addition, we exposed cells to controlled steady-state levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, mimicking the physiological production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in vivo. This methodology allows to study the biological effects of low to moderate levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and by using it we were able to show that in yeast the overall GAPDH activity only decreases at high doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We also characterized the differential expression of the three Tdh isoenzymes when cells were exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>under our controlled conditions of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>delivery. In stationary-phase cells Tdh1p expression emerged as a target for regulation by low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>What are regulatory H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations?</title><p>A high enough H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>dose will eventually trigger the oxidation of cysteine residues, and so it is important to define whether the doses at which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is observed to inhibit GAPDH activity are either in the regulatory low range, or in the toxic high range of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations.</p><p>To define what a low to moderate steady-state H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>dose is, the activity of catalase, an important antioxidant enzyme that removes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, was measured. In exponential phase cells, catalase activity was upregulated for a 20 &#x003bc;M steady-state H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>exposure and for 40 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>there was a two-fold increase in catalase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). As to stationary-phase, cells treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>on the lower range of concentrations studied (50 &#x003bc;M) showed an increase in catalase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This increase in catalase activity was modest when compared to that observed in exponential-phase cells, probably because catalase activity in stationary-phase cells is 15-fold higher than in exponential-phase cells, reflecting a probable higher formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>due to mitochondrial respiration. However, for our purpose this increase in catalase activity observed at 50 &#x003bc;M steady-state H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>was sufficient to identify a range of concentrations where H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>triggers a regulatory response. <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>has two catalases, peroxisomal catalase (catalase A) and cytosolic catalase (catalase T), encoded by the <italic>CTA1 </italic>and <italic>CTT1 </italic>genes respectively, and both are known to be induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent upregulation of <italic>CTT1 </italic>expression has been shown to be dependent on the transcription factors Yap1p, Skn7p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and Msn2p/Msn4p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and it should be pointed out that the minimum H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration needed to activate those transcription factors, when using a bolus addition, was found to be 100 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>increase catalase activity in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></bold>.

The difference in the enzyme activity in both assays measures GAPDH reversible inactivation due either to S-glutathionylation, formation of a sulphenic acid or of an intramolecular disulfide. In control cells the activity of GAPDH measured in the absence of DTT was approximately 10% lower than in the presence of DTT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), indicating either that the enzyme was partially oxidized in vivo or that it became oxidized during protein extraction. This partial oxidation of GAPDH in unstressed cells has been previously found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. If the reversible inactivation of GAPDH induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, namely by S-glutathionylation, has an important role in the regulation of GAPDH activity during oxidative stress it should be expected that a higher reversible inactivation of the enzyme would occur when cells are exposed to low to average H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations (i.e., 20-50 &#x003bc;M, as defined in the previous point).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations do not inactivate GAPDH in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></bold>.

This dose is 8 times higher than the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration identified as being able to induce catalase activity and is close to the steady-state 150 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>dose that induces a multi-factorial cellular response causing adaptation to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Previous studies of GAPDH inactivation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in yeast were done with bolus additions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which require the use of a much higher initial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration. When a typical bolus addition of 2 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>was added to exponential-phase cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), after 30 min GAPDH activity had decreased to 10% of that in control cells (1.73 &#x000b1; 0.10 and 0.17 &#x000b1; 0.09 U/mg in control and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells respectively). Part of this inactivation induced by the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>bolus addition was due to reversible GAPDH thiol oxidation since GAPDH activity in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells measured in the presence of DTT was about 47% of that in control cells (1.99 &#x000b1; 0.18 and 0.93 &#x000b1; 0.20 U/mg for control cells and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells respectively). So, a much higher steady-state concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(500 &#x003bc;M) was used in order to try to obtain a similar GAPDH inactivation to that observed when using a bolus addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. When exponential-phase cells were exposed to a steady-state 500 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration, GAPDH activity showed a marked decrease (to 26% and 40% of GAPDH activity in the absence and presence of DTT, respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). However, it should be noted that similarly to what happens with a 2 mM bolus H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>addition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], cell survival when cells are subjected to a steady-state 500 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration is lower than 50% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, for cells in the exponential phase GAPDH activity is largely unresponsive to low to moderate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>levels, in opposition to a widely accepted view.

As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> the mouse anti-GAPDH (Chemicon MAB374) reacted only with Tdh2p and Tdh3p (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), while the rabbit anti-GAPDH reacted with all three isoforms present in stationary-phase cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Tdh1p identification was confirmed using a <italic>tdh1</italic>&#x00394; strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Tdh1p was not detected in exponential-phase cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), which is in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] where Tdh1p has been described as a minor GAPDH isoenzyme only expressed in the stationary phase of growth.

However, in most of these studies, cells are exposed to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations several orders of magnitude higher (millimolar) than the physiological concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], due to its rapid removal by intracellular catalases and peroxidases. Therefore, protein oxidation and enzyme inactivation caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>has been mostly established for situations when cells were under severe oxidative stress and already dying either by apoptosis or necrosis, and thus very far from a regulatory situation. Much less is known [e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]] about the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration ranges (micromolar) where H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>may affect signaling processes and protein function through reversible changes in protein thiols redox state. In this work, a calibrated method of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>delivery to cells was used where cells were exposed to steady-state concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>throughout the experiment, which allows the use of much smaller concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This made possible to study for the first time in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cells how low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>affect GAPDH activity and expression. Our study showed that GADPH activity in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cells, both in the exponential-phase and stationary-phase of growth, is not inhibited by exposure to exogenous low to moderate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>levels. This was unexpected considering previous studies of GAPDH inactivation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and suggests that in yeast cells exposed to low to moderate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations the enzymatic systems responsible for the maintenance of cellular protein thiols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], have enough activity to maintain the SH groups of the reactive cysteine residues in the GAPDH active centre mostly in the reduced form, thus avoiding inactivation of the enzyme. Also, <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>exponential-phase cells response to high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>doses includes the upregulation of the proteins involved in the glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], which are responsible for the reduction of protein disulfides.</p><p>Stationary-phase cells have higher resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>than exponential phase cells which is in part due to the higher catalase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and also to a lower cellular permeability to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. So, when exposed to the same exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration stationary-phase cells have a lower intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration than exponential-phase cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Also, the levels of glutaredoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and thioredoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] expression are upregulated in the stationary phase of growth. This probably partially explains why in stationary-phase cells overall GAPDH activity is not inhibited for the whole range of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations used in this work. Unlike what happens for exponential-phase cells, where Tdh2p and Tdh3p levels are not altered by exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and Tdh1p is not detected, in stationary-phase cells Tdh2p and Tdh3p levels were slightly downregulated at higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations. In spite of this result, overall GAPDH activity and total GAPDH mRNA steady-state levels in stationary-phase cells are not altered by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(results not shown). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that, in spite of the decrease in the total amount of Tdh3p plus Tdh2p, the relative proportion of Tdh2p versus Tdh3p is increased. It is known that the three isoenzymes have different kinetic constants since it has been determined that Tdh3p has a two- to three-fold lower apparent V<sub>max </sub>than Tdh2p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Also, it can be hypothesized that Tdh1p upregulation observed at low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations is compensating for the decreased levels of Tdh2p/Tdh3p, the overall net result being that GAPDH activity is maintained constant.</p><p>Tdh1p levels have also been previously found to be induced by reductive stress caused by an excess of cytoplasmic NADH in an anaerobically grown <italic>gpd2</italic>&#x00394; strain lacking one of the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This upregulation of Tdh1p expression by changes in cellular redox state may be related to its function in signaling pathways, possibly the Hog1p pathway. In fact, in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] showed that in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>stress, the Cys-152 of Tdh1p is transiently oxidized. This oxidation enhances the association of Tdh1p with Mcs4p (mitotic catastrophe suppressor) and Mpr1p, a protein that transfers a phosphoryl group from the Mak2/Mak3 sensor histidine kinases activated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The equivalent pathway in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>is the Hog1p pathway involved in the response to increased extracellular osmolarity, which is also activated by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>In the last years the paradigm found in the literature is that GAPDH is a sensitive protein target of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and that its inhibition by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is a controlled response advantageous for cells because it diverts glucose from the glycolytic pathway to the pentose phosphate pathway, thus increasing the availability of NADPH for antioxidant enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In favor of such an hypothesis, a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced GAPDH inactivation to about 20% of control resulted in an increase in the levels of the metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway. Also, a mathematical model indicated that for those levels of GAPDH inhibition there was a change in the NADPH/NADP<sup>+ </sup>ratio from 6.5 to 19, with a steep increase in the ratio for levels of GAPDH inactivation greater than about 40%. Ralser <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] used that evidence as support of a model where GAPDH functions as a cellular switch that reroutes the carbohydrate flux to maintain the cytoplasmic NADPH/NADP<sup>+ </sup>equilibrium to counteract oxidative stress. However, as shown by this work, those levels of GAPDH inactivation can only be attained under severe oxidative stress when cells are dying. Therefore, this rerouting of the glycolytic carbohydrate flux due to GAPDH inhibition, although it may be important in pathophysiological situations, is not a physiological regulatory response. Moreover, the higher GAPDH activity observed after exhaustion of carbon sources in stationary-phase cells when compared to glucose-based growth in exponential-phase cells argues against the rerouting of carbohydrate flux being an important physiological mechanism. This higher GAPDH activity in stationary-phase cells also supports the paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] that GAPDH has other functions in the cell besides its role in glycolysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this work has shown that in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>GAPDH activity is largely unresponsive to low to moderate doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This highlights the importance of studies of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress using concentrations closer to the physiological for determining the importance of protein oxidation phenomena in the regulation of cellular metabolism. Most other studies of GAPDH in yeast have used considerably higher concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>than we used which lead to conclusions that are possibly only important in situations of necrosis and apoptosis.
