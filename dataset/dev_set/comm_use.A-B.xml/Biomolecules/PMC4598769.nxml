This strategy takes advantage of the differences in cell proliferation between normal and cancer cells. Chemotherapeutic drugs are usually designed to target rapid-dividing cells because sustained proliferation is a common feature of cancer [1,2]. Rapid DNA replication is essential for highly proliferative cells, thus blocking of DNA replication will create numerous mutations and/or chromosome rearrangements&#x02014;ultimately triggering cell death [3]. Along these lines, DNA topoisomerase inhibitors are of great interest because they help to maintain strand breaks generated by topoisomerases during replication. In this article, we discuss the characteristics of topoisomerase (DNA) I (TOP1) and its inhibitors, as well as the underlying DNA repair pathways and the use of TOP1 inhibitors in cancer therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>topoisomerase (DNA) I (TOP1)</kwd><kwd>anticancer therapy</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>topoisomerase inhibitor</kwd><kwd>DNA double-strand break (DSB)</kwd><kwd>DSB repair</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination (HR)</kwd><kwd>non-homologous end joining</kwd><kwd>single-strand break (SSB) repair</kwd><kwd>one-ended DSB</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>1. Type IB Topoisomerases and Inhibitors</title><sec><title>1.1. TOP1</title><p>DNA topoisomerases resolve topological constraints that may arise from DNA strand separation and are therefore important for transcription and replication [<xref rid="B4-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are six topoisomerases in humans, classified as Type IA, IB and IIA. Type IA topoisomerases TOP3&#x003b1; and TOP3&#x003b2; cleave one DNA strand to relax only negative supercoiling. In addition, TOP3&#x003b1; forms the BTR complex with BLM and RMI1/2, which plays a role in the dissolution of double-Holliday junctions [<xref rid="B5-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Type IIA topoisomerases TOP2&#x003b1; and TOP2&#x003b2; generate double-strand breaks on one DNA molecule to allow the passing of other DNA strands [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Topoisomerases are attractive drug targets in cancer therapy. For example, the commonly used anticancer agents doxorubicin and etoposide (VP-16) are TOP2 inhibitors [<xref rid="B7-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Type IB topoisomerases include the nuclear TOP1 and mitochondrial TOP1mt [<xref rid="B4-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. TOP1 initiates the DNA relaxation by nicking one DNA strand. It then forms a TOP1-DNA cleavage complex (TOP1cc) by covalently linked to the 3'-phosphate end via its tyrosine residue Y723 (3'-P-Y). Following the resolution of topological entanglements and the removal of TOP1, the 5'-hydroxyl end is realigned with the 3'-end for religation. Each nicking-closing cycle enables the relaxation of one DNA supercoiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-05-01652-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="biomolecules-05-01652-f001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A schematic representation of strand passages catalyzed by three types of topoisomerases (adapted from ref. [<xref rid="B8-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="biomolecules-05-01652-g001"/></fig><p>TOP1 is essential for embryonic development in mammals [<xref rid="B9-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although TOP1 plays an important role in the deconvolution of supercoils arising amid DNA replication, the precise steps involved with the recruitment of TOP1 to topological constraints remains to be revealed. It appears that in yeast TOP1 travels at a distance of 600 bp ahead of the replication fork [<xref rid="B10-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and remains associated with the GINS-MCM complex [<xref rid="B11-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the yeast TOP1 is distinct from its human counterpart in that it has little effect on fork progression or the firing of replication origin [<xref rid="B12-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In humans, TOP1 binds to the regions of the pre-replicative complex in cells during the M, early G1, and G1/S phases of the cell cycle to control the firing of replication origins [<xref rid="B12-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This difference may explain why yeast cells are viable in the absence of TOP1. In addition, TOP1 also has functions in transcription that are independent of its role in resolving DNA topological entanglements. First, TOP1 is known to repress transcription by binding to TFIID [<xref rid="B13-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Second, inhibition of TOP1 can cause the induction of c-Jun in leukemia cells, suggesting its additional role in the control of transcription [<xref rid="B14-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, TOP1 interacts with the splicing factor ASF/SF2 by which it promotes the maturation of RNA&#x02014;through suppressing the formation of R-loops (RNA-DNA hybrids)&#x02014;and prevents collision between transcription bubble and replication fork [<xref rid="B15-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It appears that the levels of TOP1 have to be dynamically regulated. In B cells, TOP1 is reduced by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to facilitate class-switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) [<xref rid="B17-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although TOP1mt is important for mitochondrial integrity and metabolism, mice lacking mitochondrial TOP1mt are viable and fertile but they are associated with increased negative supercoiling of mtDNA [<xref rid="B19-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>1.2. TOP1 Inhibitors</title><p>Stabilization of TOP1cc by topoisomerase poison is detrimental to cells due to the disruption of DNA uncoiling, increased strand breaks, and unstable RNA transcripts as well as incomplete DNA replication [<xref rid="B21-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The TOP1 inhibitor camptothecin (CPT), first isolated from the Chinese tree <italic>Camptotheca acuminate</italic>, was clinically used for cancer treatment long before it was identified as a TOP1 inhibitor [<xref rid="B22-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Due to side effects, CPT is no longer used clinically and it has been replaced by more effective and safer TOP1 inhibitors [<xref rid="B23-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Currently, CPT derivatives topotecan (trade name: Hycamtin) and irinotecan (CPT-11, trade name: Camptosar) are routinely used to treat colorectal, ovarian and lung cancers, while a few other TOP1 inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials.</p><p>CPT is a 5-ring alkaloid that is active in its closed E-ring (lactone) form but it is inactive with an open E-ring (carboxylate) at physiological and alkaline pH [<xref rid="B24-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, CPT is not effective for inhibiting TOP1mt due to a higher pH mitochondrial environment. The inactive form of CPT tends to bind to serum albumin, which might be a reason for its side effects. CPT is highly specific for TOP1 and the binding is of relatively low affinity and can be reversed after drug removal. These features make the action of CPT controllable [<xref rid="B24-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and in fact CPT is widely used in studies of replication-associated DNA damage response. There are a few CPT derivatives and non-CPT TOP1 inhibitors [<xref rid="B4-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B24-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, CPT derivatives Diflomotecan and S39625 were designed to stabilize the E-ring. Irinotecan has the bis-piperidine side chain to increase its water solubility, but it also contributes to some side effects. Non-CPTs&#x02014;such as indolocarbazoles, phenanthrolines (e.g., ARC-111) and indenoisoquinolines&#x02014;refer to drugs that have no typical CPT E-ring structures but they can still specifically target TOP1 and bind irreversibly to TOP1cc. Some of the CPT derivatives (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Gimatecan and Belotecan) and non-CPTs (<italic>i.e.</italic>, NSC 725776 and NSC 724998) are presently tested in clinical trials [<xref rid="B23-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>How does CPT trap TOP1cc? Analysis of the crystal structure and modeling suggest that CPT-TOP1-DNA forms a ternary complex to prevent the two DNA ends from religation [<xref rid="B25-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although it is still controversial on how CPT is intercalated into DNA, it seems that CPT traps TOP1cc with a thymine (T) at the &#x02212;1 position and a guanine (G) at the +1 position on the scissile strand, and it is therefore sequence-specific [<xref rid="B28-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Three amino acid residues of the TOP1 enzyme, R364, D533 and N722, combined with DNA bases, contribute to the stabilization of the ternary complex by forming hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. It is of note that several point mutations, including N722S, in <italic>Camptotheca acuminata</italic> TOP1 confer resistance to CPT [<xref rid="B29-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, the same amino acids also contribute to the inhibition of TOP1 by non-CPT drugs [<xref rid="B24-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>2. Repair of TOP1 Poison-Induced DNA Lesions</title><p>As aforementioned, CPT-induced trapping of TOP1cc creates a single strand break with a free 5'-hydroxyl group, whereas the 3'-phosphate is connected to Y723 of TOP1 (3'-P-Y). At least two pathways contribute to the repair of DNA lesions created by TOP1 poison [<xref rid="B30-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The tyrosyl-DNA-phosphodiesterase (TDP1) pathway starts with the ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of TOP1 in the CPT-TOP1-DNA complex to generate a 3'-P end linked to a short peptide [<xref rid="B31-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. TDP1 then cleaves the P-Y bond to release the 3'-P end; however, the 3'-P end cannot be directly ligated to the 5'-OH end because of the requirements of DNA ligases. The human polynucleotide kinase (PNKP) can process the DNA ends by functioning as both a 3'-phosphatase and a kinase to generate the required 3'-OH and 5'-P termini for direct ligation. The rest of the repair events can be best described by the single-strand break (SSB) repair pathway, which will be discussed below. Indeed, TDP1 and PNKP are tightly associated with the SSB repair machinery [<xref rid="B32-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The endonuclease pathway requires multiple endonucleases to excise the DNA&#x02014;usually at a few nucleotides away from the 3'-P-TOP1 end &#x02013; on the scissile strand to release the DNA-TOP1 complex [<xref rid="B30-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Initial studies were carried out to identify genes that functioned in CPT repair in the absence of TDP1 in yeast [<xref rid="B34-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These studies led to the identification of RAD1-RAD10, SLX1-SLX4, MUS81-MMS4, MRE11-SAE2 as well as genes involved in recombination. The RAD1-RAD10 (human XPF/ERCC4-ERCC1) complex is a DNA structure-specific endonuclease that can act on 5' overhang structures [<xref rid="B36-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interestingly, the cleavage site of XPF-ERCC1 is in the non-protruding DNA strand, about 3&#x02013;4 nucleotides away from the 3' end [<xref rid="B36-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, trapped TOP1ccs can be removed by this endonuclease activity. Likewise, MUS81-MMS4 (human MUS81-EME1) can also cleave nicked duplex at the 5' of the nick [<xref rid="B37-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The SLX1-SLX4 endonuclease, although not tested on nicked duplexes, is able to process 3' flap and other DNA structures [<xref rid="B38-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In human cells, SLX4 also associates with XPF-ERCC1 and MUS81-EME1 endonucleases to process specific DNA intermediates [<xref rid="B39-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, MRE11-RAD50 cleaves the 3'-P-Y bond and resects DNA to produce a 3'-OH end [<xref rid="B41-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A direct role of SAE2 (human CtIP) in processing 3'-P-TOP1 is unknown, and its endonuclease activity appears to be limited to the 5' flap or DNA &#x0201c;hairpin&#x0201d; structures [<xref rid="B42-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Nonetheless, the endonuclease activity of CtIP is essential for processing CPT adducts [<xref rid="B42-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, like CtIP, the 5' flap endonuclease RAD27 (human FEN1) seems to be unable to directly process 3'-P-TOP1 ends [<xref rid="B44-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the gap endonuclease activity of FEN1 is important for processing stalled replication forks and CPT-induced adducts [<xref rid="B45-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The role of FEN1 in SSB repair will be discussed further in the next section.</p><p>During DNA replication, SSBs created by CPT are most likely converted to double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication fork runoff. This conversion appears to be dependent on the proteolysis of TOP1 [<xref rid="B46-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The repair of one-ended DSBs, as will be discussed in the next section, is largely dependent on homologous recombination (HR). However, low doses of CPT may also induce PARP1 and/or RAD51 dependent replication fork regression&#x02014;generating no or few DSBs [<xref rid="B47-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The regressed fork leads to the formation of a &#x0201c;chicken foot&#x0201d; DNA structure by newly synthesized strands [<xref rid="B3-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B49-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The formation of regressed fork can be largely suppressed by ATR, EXO1, and DNA2 [<xref rid="B51-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, fork reversal can also be beneficial as it provides time for the repair of TOP1-induced DNA lesions by TDP1, thereby preventing DSB formation and the activation of error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) [<xref rid="B30-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>3. Pathways Involved in the Repair of CPT-Induced DNA Lesions</title><p>Normal cells use DNA damage response (DDR) pathways to maintain genomic stability [<xref rid="B54-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. As aforementioned, SSB and DSB repair mechanisms are the two major DDR pathways that repair TOP1-induced DNA lesions. Paradoxically, cancer cells exploit DDR pathways to accumulate necessary genomic alterations for promoting proliferation. Furthermore, altered DDR and apoptotic responses in cancer cells are the major obstacles to successful chemotherapy. Thus, the delineation of TOP1-related SSB and DSB repair mechanisms is of great importance for identifying drug targets that can selectively affect cancer cell survival.</p><sec><title>3.1. Single-Strand Break (SSB) Repair</title><p>Trapping of TOP1cc results in a 3'-P-TOP1 end and a 5'-OH terminus. Because the two ends cannot be directly religated, the persisting SSB is likely to be detected by PARP1 in which activated PARP1 catalyzes the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains for recruiting repair proteins [<xref rid="B55-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This reaction can be rapidly reversed by PARG, which hydrolyzes the PAR chains. The PAR chains at the SSB sites are important for the recruitment of XRCC1 that functions as a loading dock for other SSB repair proteins including TDP1 and PNKP. TDP1 generates 3'-P and PNKP converts 3'-P to 3'-OH, and PNKP also converts 5'-OH to 5'-P, making ends compatible for religation with no base loss. The rejoining of the 3'-OH and 5'-P ends is mainly mediated by LIG3, in which XRCC1 mediates the recruitment of LIG3.</p><p>If the trapped TOP1cc intermediates are processed by endonucleases, the initial SSBs will be converted to 3'-OH and 5'-OH ends with a gap over a few nucleotides (in the case of XPF-ERCC1, the loss is in the range of 3&#x02013;4 nt), leading to the activation of PARP1 and XRCC1 recruitment. Consequentially, Pol&#x003b2; recruited by XRCC1 can catalyze the gap filling, and PCNA-Pol&#x003b4;/&#x003b5; also plays a role in this process [<xref rid="B55-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. If the 5'-OH is not processed by PNKP, the 5'-flap resulted from gap filling is likely to be removed by FEN1, which explains why FEN1 deficiency also leads to an increased CPT sensitivity. The final ligation is catalyzed by LIG1 because of the presence of PCNA.</p></sec><sec><title>3.2. Double-Strand Break (DSB) Repair</title><p>Successful DSB repair requires concerted actions of proteins involved in DNA damage signaling and repair [<xref rid="B54-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. To repair TOP1 poison-induced DNA lesions, ATR signaling is required due to the runoff of replication fork and the presence of long single-strand DNA (ssDNA) [<xref rid="B56-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The full activation of ATR follows a &#x0201c;two-man&#x0201d; rule&#x02014;the ssDNA-ATRIP-dependent recruitment of ATR kinase and the RAD17 clamp loader/9-1-1/TOPBP1 mediator loading at the ssDNA-dsDNA junction. ATR phosphorylates CHEK1 to harness cell cycle arrest. If one-ended DSB is formed, ATM will be activated through the action of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex. ATM mainly phosphorylates CHEK2 to mediate cell cycle arrest. Both ATM and ATR are able to phosphorylate hundreds of proteins in response to DSB formation [<xref rid="B57-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. One remarkable substrate is the histone H2AX, which can be phosphorylated by both kinases to yield &#x003b3;-H2AX. It is conceived that the propagation of &#x003b3;-H2AX signaling along the chromatin facilitates MDC1 recruitment and BRCA1 signaling via the MDC1-RNF8-RNF168-RAP80 ubiquitin cascade&#x02014;events that are essential for HR [<xref rid="B58-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>The repair of TOP1 poison-induced DNA lesions is in essence the repair of one-ended DSBs, which facilitates the restoration of replication forks to restart DNA replication. It is important to note that one-ended DSB repair occurs in the S phase and relies on HR rather than NHEJ [<xref rid="B59-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The first step in HR is end resection to generate a 3'-overhang for homology searching. A TOP1 cleavage in the leading strand may require end resection by the MRN-CtIP-BRCA1 and BLM-EXO1-DNA2 complexes [<xref rid="B60-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], whereas a cleavage in the lagging strand automatically forms a 3'-overhang. Rad51 then associates with the 3'-ssDNA to form a nucleofilament for strand invasion, which leads to the formation of a D-loop structure [<xref rid="B61-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This process continues with DNA synthesis, branch migration and the resolution of Holliday junction structures to reconstitute a functional replication fork [<xref rid="B62-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. TOP1 poisons can also lead to the formation of two-ended DSB if two replication forks collide into each other at the site of SSB. The repair of this type of DSBs is not aimed for fork restoration and can be accomplished by the classical DSB repair mechanisms [<xref rid="B61-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>3.3. Genes Involved in CPT-Induced Damage Repair</title><p>A long list of genes, in which mutations confer sensitivity to CPT in yeast, chicken or mammalian cells, has been compiled [<xref rid="B24-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B30-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B63-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. With no surprise, many genes involved in SSB and DSB repair are on the list, such as PARP1, XRCC1, PNKP, TDP1 for SSB repair; MRN, ATM-CHK2, ATR-CHK1 for DSB signaling; BRCA1/2, XRCC2, XRCC3 for HR. Most recently, the hMSH5-FANCJ complex has also been implicated to play a role in CPT-induced DNA damage response and repair [<xref rid="B64-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Mutations in the binding partners of these repair factors are also likely to sensitize cells to CPT treatment. For example, depletion of the MRN-binding partner hnRNPUL increases the sensitivity to CPT [<xref rid="B65-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]; and deficiencies in ZRANB3 and SPIDR, binding partners of PCNA and RAD51, cause CPT hypersensitivity in cancer cells [<xref rid="B66-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In addition, the two DNA helicases BLM and WRN have also been implicated in the repair of CPT-induced DNA lesions [<xref rid="B69-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Early studies revealed that chicken BLM knockout cells and human BLM-deficient fibroblasts showed increased sensitivity to CPT [<xref rid="B71-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B72-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. On the contrary, mouse BLM knockout embryonic stem cells showed mild resistance to CPT [<xref rid="B73-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This discrepancy is likely attributable to the complexity of CPT-induced DNA lesion repair as well as different treatment conditions and experimental systems.</p><p>Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) resemble CPT-induced lesions in that they block both replication and transcription [<xref rid="B74-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. They may induce replication fork reversal and fork collapse, which require DNA incision for lesion processing and HR for repair. ICL repair is accomplished by the coordinated actions of 17 Fanconi anemia (FA) genes whose mutations contribute to FA in patients [<xref rid="B75-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Depletion of FANCP/SLX4 or FANCQ/XPF causes cellular sensitivity to CPT because they form an endonuclease complex involved in the repair of trapped TOP1cc [<xref rid="B38-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Likewise, depletion of FANCS/BRCA1, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN/PALB2 or FANCO/RAD51C sensitizes cells to CPT because of their involvement in HR [<xref rid="B76-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Accordingly, depletion of the FA core complex except FANCM&#x02014;involved in fork reversal&#x02014;is not expected to increase CPT sensitivity because they are unable to recognize the trapped TOP1cc [<xref rid="B76-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. However, the roles of FANCI, D2, J and FAN1 in the process are elusive due to conflicting reports presumably reflecting different experimental systems [<xref rid="B76-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="B77-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. For example, in a multicolor competition assay, loss of FANCI or FAN1 rendered cells sensitive to CPT treatment [<xref rid="B77-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. However, this observation could not be recapitulated in studies performed with FANCI-deficient lymphoblasts and FAN1-depleted HEK293 cells [<xref rid="B76-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="B79-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], indicating that the involvement of these two genes in CTP sensitivity might be cell type specific.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the MMS22L-TONSL complex plays a prominent role in mediating CPT sensitivity [<xref rid="B80-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="B83-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Depletion of this complex impairs RAD51 foci formation and triggers G2/M arrest, indicating that the MMS22L-TONSL complex participates in HR repair. Furthermore, this complex associates with MCM, FACT, ASF1 and histones. FACT and ASF1 are histone chaperones that function in H2A/H2B and H3/H4 chromatin assembly and disassembly, respectively [<xref rid="B84-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. They recycle parental histones from old DNA strands unwound by MCM and incorporate them into newly synthesized DNA strands. FACT and ASF1 also function in checkpoint signaling; therefore the involvement of MMS22L-TONSL in CPT response implies the existence of a close association between HR, DNA damage signaling and replication restart.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>4. TOP1 Inhibition in Cancer Treatment</title><p>The understanding of the function of TOP1 and the cellular effects of TOP1 inhibition has been a stepping-stone for the development of effective CPT derivatives in cancer therapy. Since TOP1 functions in normal and cancer cells, the use of low doses of TOP1 inhibitors are actively sought to treat cancers that heavily rely on the function of TOP1 for survival (e.g., highly malignant, rapid-dividing tumor cells). In fact, the FDA-approved CPT derivatives topotecan and irinotecan are currently used to treat ovarian and colorectal cancers, respectively [<xref rid="B24-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, the promising results from a Phase I trial have warranted further evaluation of the CPT derivative Diflomotecan in Phase II trials [<xref rid="B85-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Other derivatives like Gimatecan, Lurtotecan and Exatecan are also being tested in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="table" rid="biomolecules-05-01652-t001">Table 1</xref>). The non-CPT indolocarbazole BMS-250749 showed great anti-tumor activity against preclinical xenograft models [<xref rid="B86-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], but no further evaluation beyond Phase I trials is presently available (<xref ref-type="table" rid="biomolecules-05-01652-t002">Table 2</xref>). Another indolocarbazole compound Edotecarin has shown promising anti-tumor activity in xenograft models and it is now advanced to Phase II studies of patients with advanced solid tumors [<xref rid="B87-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. By contrast, Phenanthroline ARC-111 (topovale) was potently against human tumor xenografts and displayed anti-cancer activity in colon and Wilms&#x02019; tumors [<xref rid="B88-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]; however, no result from Phase I clinical trials is available owing to profound bone marrow toxicity [<xref rid="B89-biomolecules-05-01652" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. To date, indenoisoquinolines are the most promising non-CPT inhibitors in clinical trials. LMP400 (NSC 743400, indotecan) and LMP776 (NSC 725776, indimitecan) show significant anti-tumor activities in animal models and both are being evaluated in Phase I clinical trials for relapsed solid

The accumulation of DNA strand breaks (SSBs and DSBs) by TOP1 inhibition in HR-deficient tumor cells is expected to enhance cytotoxicity. However, increased DNA repair activities in cancer cells can make TOP1 inhibitors less effective, so silencing of repair pathways in conjunction with the use of TOP1 inhibitors offers an attractive new means for cancer control.

This will make it possible to achieve better and predictable prognosis through tailored therapeutic regimens. Given that TOP1 is essential for transcription and DNA replication, future design of novel TOP1 inhibitors and combinational therapy strategies should aim to increase therapeutic efficacy of the inhibitors, thus reducing side effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The work in the Her laboratory is supported by the NIH grant GM084353.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Yang Xu and Chengtao Her wrote and revised the article.</p></notes><notes><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with the contents of this article.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-biomolecules-05-01652"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
