Furthermore creatures are continuously exposed to stressful events which lead to various physiological changes. Stressful stimuli are all around archived to trigger the central monoaminergic systems and hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus surges the release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone upon activation of the HPA axis, which leads to the secretion of adrenocorticotropin from the anterior pituitary, and ultimately adrenal cortex discharges glucocorticoids <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Stress, a non-specific response of the body characterized as physical and psychological alterations that disturb the homeostasis and the balance of the organism resulting in various neuronal, endocrine and visceral dysfunction <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Physical stressor like loud noise, big crowds and cluttered surrounding causes stress. According to previous reports, glucocorticoids released by CS disrupt the useful homeostasis of the body and are also associated in the etiopathogenesis of a diversity of disease conditions like coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, gastric ulcers, mental depression, immunosuppression and memory loss <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. No such medicine is mentioned in current pharmacopoeia which could be utilized as a treatment for stress. Nevertheless, a few plants in folkore medication such as <italic>Bacopa monniera, Panax ginseng</italic>, <italic>Emblica officinalis</italic>, <italic>Withania somnifera, Evolvulus alsinoides</italic> and <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> have been assessed for their adaptogenic effects <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Previously, some polyherbal formulations have been found to be effective in stress <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Oxitard is one more herbal antioxidant formulation comprising the extracts of <italic>W. somnifera, Mangifera indica, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Daucus carota, Vitis vinifera,</italic> powders of <italic>Syzygium aromaticum, Yashada bhasma and E. officinalis; and oils of Triticum sativum</italic>
<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Previous reports indicate the beneficial role of Oxitard in oral submucous fibrosis <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>According to general hypothesis, intelligence (I) energy (E), and organization (O), the three fundamental elements control the strength of an individual <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and adaptogens adjust these battleaxes of healthiness by providing energy, informational and organizational aid to cell arrangements establishing the body <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Non-ideal prescriptions perform by improving maybe a couple components, but concurrently destroy the residual one(s), leading to adverse effects <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Nevertheless, adaptogens activate bi-directional alteration by triggering and re-establishing the balance of all three factors in an ideal way <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Animals are exposed to the similar kind of stressor for diverse phases to induce CS experimentally. Previous reports state that animals have a tendency to adjust to exposure to a similar kind of stressor in CS. To overcome this, the animals are exposed to flexible stressors of diverse amount and time in the form of CUS <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Additionally, CUS model shows high level of stress related outcomes as compared to CS. Taking into account these findings, in the present study the two models (i.e., CS and CUS) were utilized to assess the adaptogenic effects of Oxitard (a polyherbal formulation), as there are no reports found about the adaptogenic potential of Oxitard till date. The current study was therefore designed to explore the adaptogenic potential of Oxitard in CS and CUS-induced dysfunctional homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Animals</title><p>Male albino Wistar rats (180&#x02013;220&#x000a0;gm) and male Swiss albino mice (25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;gm) maintained at standard laboratory diet (Kisan Feeds Ltd., Chandigarh, India) and having free access to water <italic>ad libitum</italic>, were utilized in the present study.

According to previous reports, free radicals have been produced by stress <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, which further increase corticosterone secretion through hyper-actuation of the HPA axis <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. On the other hand, HPA over-stimulation brought about by free radicals elevates corticosterone secretion by disrupting hippocampal neurons, which sustain the homeostasis of the HPA axis by negative feedback system <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Previous study signifies the key role of free radicals in stress-induced related pathological effects and biochemical imbalance <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Additionally, stress reduces the GSH level and prompts to elevated ROS levels in rodent tissues <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Strong evidence suggests that the GSH system facilitates an enzymatic antioxidant defense system against hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, an immobilization stress leads to lipid peroxidation by overproduction of free radicals, mainly in cell membranes <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Previous studies also showed a significant reduction of CAT level in stressed animals <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In the present study, pre-treatment with Oxitard improvised CS and CUS-associated oxidative stress parameters in terms of elevation of GSH, CAT and decrease in MDA levels, signifying that adaptogenic potential of Oxitard might be contributed by its free radical scavenging property.</p><p>Increased secretion of stress hormones, which are identified to increase the mRNA levels and metabolic activities in the hepatic cells, could be the reason behind increased weight of liver during stress. Furthermore, adrenal hyperplasia and hypertrophy is known to be caused by powerful stimulation of the adrenal glands throughout delayed stress conditions <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Stress induced adrenomedullary response leads to hyperactivity of adrenals in stressed animals which increases the production of corticotropic hormone and ultimately results in increased weight of adrenals <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The result indicates that the decreased weight of liver and adrenal glands following pre-treatment with Oxitard might be due to the reversal of stress induced adrenomedullary response and consequently decreased production of corticotropic hormone. Decreased weight of spleen during stress is due to its contraction which releases more amount of blood (RBC) into circulation <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Increased weight of spleen following pre-treatment with Oxitard might be due to the inhibition of recruitment of lymphocytes to blood from spleen. The weight of testis decreases because there is destruction of spermatogenesis and reduction of testosterone levels during stress <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Pre-treatment with Oxitard significantly increased weight of testis indicating its anti-stress property. Stress also causes alteration in hematological parameters like increase in total and differential WBC counts <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Significant reduction of RBC and WBC counts as compared to stressed rats following pre-treatment of Oxitard authenticated the adaptogenic potential of Oxitard. Since gastric mucosal blood flow plays an essential role in defensive mechanism of gastric mucosa, its disruption results in beginning of ulcers <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In our study, Oxitard treatment significantly diminished the occurrences and severities of ulcers caused by CS and CUS. This further validated the adaptogenic potential of Oxitard. Thus Oxitard could be a better candidate in the treatment of stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Oxitard showed antioxidant property and prevented the stress-induced alterations in body weight, organ weight, ulcer index and hematological parameters, indicating its protective effect against stress. Oxitard-facilitated antioxidant actions might be the reason behind its defensive effects in stress-induced dysfunctional homeostasis. However, further experiments are required to discover the mechanism behind the adaptogenic potential of Oxitard utilizing different animal models of stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kvetnansky</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pacak</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fukuhara</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Viskupic</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hiremagalur</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nankova</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sympathoadrenal system in stress.
