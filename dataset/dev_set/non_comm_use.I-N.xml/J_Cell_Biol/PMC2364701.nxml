The molecular mechanism of centrosome duplication remains unclear. Previous studies found that a fraction of human proline-directed phosphatase Cdc14B associates with centrosomes. However, Cdc14B's involvement in centrosome cycle control has never been explored. Here, we show that depletion of Cdc14B by RNA interference leads to centriole amplification in both HeLa and normal human fibroblast BJ and MRC-5 cells. Induction of Cdc14B expression through a regulatable promoter significantly attenuates centriole amplification in prolonged S phase&#x02013;arrested cells and proteasome inhibitor Z-L<sub>3</sub>VS&#x02013;treated cells. This inhibitory function requires centriole-associated Cdc14B catalytic activity. Together, these results suggest a potential function for Cdc14B phosphatase in maintaining the fidelity of centrosome duplication cycle.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>J.

Numerical and structural centrosome aberrations have been implicated in almost all types of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saunders, 2005</xref>). Despite the apparent link between centrosome amplification and cancer, research is still in the early stages of understanding the molecular mechanisms of centrosome regulation and its deregulation in human diseases. Centrosome aberrations have been implicated in the generation of multipolar mitotic spindles and chromosomal instability during tumor development and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saunders, 2005</xref>). The proline-directed phosphatase Cdc14 has been extensively studied in budding yeast where, from G1 until early anaphase, Cdc14 is sequestered in an inactive state in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Visintin et al., 1999</xref>). Cdc14 is activated after release from the nucleolus and functions primarily to inactivate Cdk activity at the end of mitosis, thereby allowing reentry into G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stegmeier and Amon, 2004</xref>). Cells that lack Cdc14 are unable to exit from mitosis, with defects in both the movement of chromosomes to the spindle poles and the elongation of anaphase spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Higuchi and Uhlmann, 2005</xref>). Human cells possess two Cdc14 paralogue, Cdc14A and Cdc14B, identified based on their sequence similarity to the budding yeast Cdc14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 1997</xref>). Studies suggest that Cdc14A and Cdc14B may be deregulated in various cancer cells including mantle cell lymphoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martinez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neben et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rubio-Moscardo et al., 2005</xref>). Recent findings indicate that Cdc14A and Cdc14B may be involved in distinctive cellular functions. Although Cdc14A regulates centrosome separation and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaiser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mailand et al., 2002</xref>), Cdc14B may participate in the maintenance of nuclear structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nalepa and Harper, 2004</xref>), regulation of mitotic exit through SIRT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dryden et al., 2003</xref>), microtubule stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2005</xref>), and G1 length through Skp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rodier et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, previous studies, including ours, have shown that a fraction of endogenous and GFP-tagged Cdc14B associated with centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nalepa and Harper, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2005</xref>). Yet, the functional significance of Cdc14B in centrosome cycle regulation has never been explored. Here, we investigate the functional relationship between Cdc14B and centriole number control in human cells using both RNA interference and a drug-induced centriole overduplication system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cdc14B centrosomal retention requires Cdc14B phosphatase activity</title><p>Cdc14B has been shown to associate with distinctive cellular structures such as the nucleolus, nuclear filament, centrosome, and the spindle midzone and midbody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaiser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mailand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nalepa and Harper, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2005</xref>), and to undergo active nucleocytoplasmic translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bembenek et al., 2005</xref>). To explore the functional significance of centrosomal Cdc14B, we first examined whether centrosomal localization of Cdc14B was cell cycle&#x02013;dependent using a chicken anti-Cdc14B antibody. After preextraction and fixation of U2OS cells, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Cdc14B partially colocalized with centrin, a marker that stains at the distal lumen of centrioles, in addition to the nucleolar, intracellular bridge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and midzone (not depicted) localization previously characterized using other anti-Cdc14B antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaiser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mailand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nalepa and Harper, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2005</xref>). Depending on the centriole configuration during different stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsou and Stearns, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nigg, 2007</xref>), Cdc14B associates with each of the disengaged centrioles in G1 and late M phase but only one of the engaged centrioles in S, G2, and early M phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Cdc14B-GFP also showed a similar cell cycle&#x02013;dependent centriole localization pattern (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710127/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710127/DC1</ext-link>). We believe that the reason we and others previously did not observe centriole-associated Cdc14B with the rabbit anti-Cdc14B antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaiser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2005</xref>) was that these antibodies might react with epitopes that were not exposed at centrioles under the extraction/fixation conditions. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nalepa and Harper (2004)</xref> found that the centrosomal Cdc14B only became visible after Triton X-100 extraction before fixation using another rabbit anti-Cdc14B antibody. To independently evaluate the centrosomal association of Cdc14B, we purified centrosome fractions from asynchronized HeLa cells by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation according to a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moudjou and Bornens, 1998</xref>). Proteins in each fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. At the expected &#x0223c;60% sucrose density, fractions 14&#x02013;17 contained the most abundant amounts of &#x003b3;-tubulin, an archetypical centrosomal marker. In parallel, Cdc14B was highly enriched in those &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;containing centrosomal fractions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, top). Moreover, when a purified centrosomal fraction (fraction 15) was subject to immunostaining, we found that Cdc14B but not nucleolin, a noncentrosomal protein, stained positive at the purified centrosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, bottom). Together, these data suggest that a fraction of Cdc14B phosphatase specifically associates with centrioles.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>A fraction of Cdc14B associates with centrioles.</bold> (A) Overlay images depict partial colocalization of endogenous Cdc14B (red) with centrin (green) in U2OS cells during different stages of the cell cycle.

As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 (A and B)</xref>, Cdc14B<sup>C314S</sup>-GFP localized in nuclei/nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2005</xref>) and was absent from the centrosomes in virtually all the interphase cells examined. In contrast, wild-type Cdc14B-GFP (Cdc14B<sup>WT</sup>-GFP) was found to associate with centrosomes in &#x0223c;75% of GFP-positive interphase cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Although these findings suggest that catalytic activity is essential for Cdc14B centrosomal localization, its perturbation may also inhibit Cdc14B nucleocytoplasmic shuttling ability, which indirectly prevents Cdc14B from reaching centrosomes in interphase cells where the nuclear envelope is still intact. To exclude this possibility, we studied the localization of Cdc14B<sup>C314S</sup>-GFP at the centrosomes of mitotic cells where the nuclear envelopes have disassembled. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, no Cdc14B<sup>C314S</sup>-GFP was found to associate with mitotic centrosomes (0%, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 113), whereas Cdc14B<sup>WT</sup>-GFP associated with a majority (61%, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 374) of mitotic centrosomes examined. This finding suggests that the failure of Cdc14B<sup>C314S</sup> centrosomal retention is not because of the lack of its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity and thus supports the possibility that Cdc14B centrosomal localization requires its catalytic activity. We previously demonstrated that the cytoplasmic translocation/microtubule bundling ability of Cdc14B<sup>C314S</sup> was impaired but restored when an additional mutation (KKIR29-32AAIA, Cdc14B<sup>KKIR</sup>) of a potential NLS was introduced to the Cdc14B<sup>C314S</sup> mutant (KKIR29-32AAIA&#x0002b;C314S, Cdc14B<sup>K&#x00026;C</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, introduction of this mutation also restored Cdc14B<sup>C314S</sup> localization to centrosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Because breakdown of the nuclear/cytoplasmic barrier in mitosis did not restore Cdc14B<sup>C314S</sup> to centrosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), this finding indicates that the additional KKIR mutation not only helps Cdc14B<sup>C314S</sup> regain cytoplasmic translocation but also acts as a gain-of-function mutant that facilitates Cdc14B<sup>C314S</sup> to reassociate with centrosomes.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Role of phosphatase activity and nucleocytoplasmic transport in Cdc14B centrosome localization.</bold> (A) Cdc14B-GFP fusion proteins were induced by DOX for 72 h in U2OS Tet-On stable cell lines carrying different Cdc14B-GFP constructs as indicated.

We first attempted to establish stable cell lines in which endogenous Cdc14B could be conditionally knocked down. In search of siRNA oligos to deplete the endogenous Cdc14B, we found that an oligo corresponding to nucleotide position 1,234&#x02013;1,254 relative to the Cdc14B start codon was most effective in ablating Cdc14B expression. We cloned this siRNA oligo into a pSuperior-neo-GFP vector and the resulting plasmid was transfected into TREx HeLa cells to obtain Cdc14B knockdown stable clones. Western blot analysis showed a reduction of endogenous Cdc14B expression in two of the representative clones (clones No. 2 and 3) in the presence of tetracycline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Consistently, real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that the level of Cdc14B mRNA level was also decreased in these two clones (unpublished data). The same siRNA could also knock down Cdc14B-GFP expression in U2OS Tet-On cells, confirming the target specificity of the Cdc14B siRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Moreover, immunostaining with the anti-Cdc14B antibody revealed that centrosomal Cdc14B expression was reduced in Cdc14BsiRNA cells (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710127/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710127/DC1</ext-link>), though the efficiency of knockdown varied in each cell. Careful examination of those Cdc14B knockdown clones revealed a centriole amplification phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). In comparison with the parental TREx HeLa and clone No. 1, which did not exhibit any reduction of Cdc14B expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), clones No. 2 and 3 showed two- to threefold increases in the number of cells with more than four centrioles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>) judged by immunostaining with an anti-centrin antibody. The centriole number usually ranged from 5 to 20 with the majority around six to eight centrioles per cell. Similar results were obtained (Fig. S2 B) when &#x003b3;-tubulin was used as a centrosome marker (Fig. S2 C). To ascertain the specificity of Cdc14B knockdown phenotype, we tested a Cdc14B siRNA oligo pool (SMARTpool containing four different Cdc14B siRNA oligos) and a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) designated as pSuperCdc14BshRNA-E9, each targeting different regions of Cdc14B mRNA sequences in transient and stable transfection studies, respectively. Western blot analysis confirmed that both the siRNA pool and the shRNA specifically knocked down Cdc14B but not its Cdc14A paralogue in HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>, top). Moreover, knockdown of Cdc14B by both the siRNA pool and shRNA led to a significant accumulation of cells with more than four centrioles in HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>, bottom). Although HeLa cells have been widely used for centrosome studies, it is a tumor cell line. To examine the effect of Cdc14B on centrosome cycle control in normal cells, we transfected normal human fibroblast BJ and MRC-5 cells with the Cdc14B siRNA SMARTpool. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the centriole amplification phenotype was faithfully reproduced in the normal fibroblast cells depleted of Cdc14B. These results demonstrate that depletion of Cdc14B leads to centrosome amplification in both normal and transformed cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Depletion of Cdc14B leads to centriole amplification in HeLa cells.</bold> (A) Western blot analysis using an anti-Cdc14B antibody showed Cdc14B knockdown in TREx-HeLa Cdc14BsiRNA stable clones No. 2 and 3 but not in TREx HeLa and clone No. 1.

Macronuclear and multinucleate cells were determined by visual judgment of the sizes (nuclear diameter and area) of DAPI-stained nuclei and the number of nuclei per cell, respectively. It is important to note that among the TREx-HeLa Cdc14BsiRNA stable cells with centriole amplifications, only &#x0223c;0.2 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 300) were polyploid. Using the same criteria, we were unable to detect any significant increase of polyploid cells in HeLa cells transiently transfected with Cdc14BsiRNA SMARTpool (Fig. S3 B). In line with this finding, flow cytometry analysis did not reveal any significant increase of polyploidy in those Cdc14B knockdown cells (Fig. S3 C).

For this purpose, we first tested if Cdc14B overexpression could inhibit HU-induced centriole overduplication in the stable doxycycline (DOX)-inducible Cdc14B<sup>WT</sup>-GFP U2OS Tet-On cells. Based on the localization of Cdc14B<sup>WT</sup>-GFP at centrioles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), the Cdc14B<sup>WT</sup>-GFP&#x02013;positive cells can be divided into two groups: Cdc14B<sup>WT</sup>-GFP at centrioles and not at centrioles. This provides an ideal system to directly examine whether localization of Cdc14B at centrioles conveys a critical function in centriole duplication. The number of centrin-labeled centrioles was counted in the inducible Cdc14B<sup>WT</sup>-GFP cells after cultivation in the presence of HU without DOX induction, and HU &#x0002b; DOX for 72 h. As expected, HU treatment led to centriole amplification in uninduced Cdc14B<sup>WT</sup>-GFP cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, bottom) or mock-transfected U2OS Tet-On cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Remarkably, this centriole amplification phenotype was significantly attenuated in cells where Cdc14B<sup>WT</sup>-GFP was at centrioles but not in cells where Cdc14B<sup>WT</sup>-GFP was not at centrioles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). This finding was confirmed in the same sets of cells treated with HU &#x0002b; DOX for 72 h using &#x003b3;-tubulin as a centrosome marker (Fig. S4, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710127/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710127/DC1</ext-link>).

Together, these results suggest that Cdc14B overexpression suppresses abnormal centriole amplification, and this inhibitory function requires the presence of Cdc14B-GFP at centrioles in the HU-induced centriole overduplication system. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that induction of Cdc14B-GFP did not perturb cell cycle progression at the expression level set by the DOX-inducible promoter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>), which suggests that the inhibition of centriole amplification in HU-arrested cells was not the result of a potential G1 cell cycle arrest.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Cdc14B phosphatase activity is required to prevent HU-induced centriole amplification.</bold> (A, top) Cdc14B-GFP fusion proteins were induced by 4 &#x003bc;g/ml DOX in the presence of 2 mM HU for 72 h in U2OS Tet-On stable cell lines carrying different Cdc14B-GFP constructs as indicated.

Because catalytic activity of Cdc14B is required to harness centriole overduplication in both HU- and Z-L<sub>3</sub>VS experimental systems, Cdc14B may exert its effect through modulating the phosphorylation status of its substrates, in particular those involved in the control of centrosome duplication. It has been well documented that the activities of centrosome-associated protein kinases, such as Cdk2/cyclin E/A, Plk2, Plk4, calcium-calmodulin kinase II, MpsI, and Zyg-1, are required for centriole duplication in various species and experimental settings including the HU- and Z-L<sub>3</sub>VS&#x02013;induced centriole overduplication systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matsumoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meraldi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisk and Winey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Connell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matsumoto and Maller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fisk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Warnke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Habedanck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsou and Stearns, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duensing et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>), which suggests that phosphorylation plays an important role for the precise reproduction of centrosomes during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsou and Stearns, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nigg, 2007</xref>). Phosphorylation of centrosome-associated proteins such as nucleophosmin/B23, CP110, and Mps1 has been implicated in centrosome duplication control. In particular, phosphorylation of B23 Thr199 by Cdk2/cyclin E and of B23 Thr95 by an unknown kinase dissociates B23 from centrosomes, which in turn allows centrosome duplication or reduplication to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okuda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budhu and Wang, 2005</xref>). Likewise, depletion of CP110 abolishes centrosome reduplication in S phase&#x02013;arrested cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>) and suppresses Plk4-induced procentriole reduplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Habedanck et al., 2005</xref>), whereas inactivation of Cdk2 activity abolishes Mps1-dependent centrosome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisk and Winey, 2001</xref>). Based on our observation in this study, it is possible that Cdc14B may regulate the centriole duplication cycle by modulating the phosphorylation status of centrosomal proteins such as B23, CP110, and Mps1.</p><p>A counterbalance of kinase and phosphatase activities involving Nek2 and PP1&#x003b1; has been proposed for governing centrosome splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meraldi and Nigg, 2001</xref>). A similar mechanism may prevail in the regulation of centrosome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nigg, 2007</xref>). To our knowledge, Cdc14B is the only phosphatase identified as a negative regulator of centrosome duplication, though a recent study shows that another phosphatase, Cdc25B, also regulates centrosome duplication, albeit as a positive regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boutros et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that Cdc14B may act to keep the centrosomes in check before and/or after centrosome duplication by opposing the activities of Cdk2 and other related kinases required for the initiation of centrosome duplication. It has been demonstrated that mammalian Cdc14s preferentially dephosphorylate Ser/Thr-proline&#x02013;directed sites of Cdk-phosphorylated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaiser et al., 2002</xref>). Cdk2/cyclin E and A are involved in the initiation of centrosome duplication in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinchcliffe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meraldi et al., 1999</xref>). In this context, Cdc14B may oppose cyclin A/Cdk2 activity to prevent centrosome reduplication because centrosome duplication terminates at the end of S phase and cyclin A/Cdk2 is still active throughout S phase and early mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pagano et al., 1992</xref>). Cdc14B may also stabilize Cdk inhibitor 1/Kip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2004</xref>) by promoting dephosphorylation-dependent Skp2 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rodier et al., 2008</xref>), which in turn inhibits Cdk2/cyclin E activity in G1 to prevent premature centriole duplication. Recent studies suggest that Plk4 plays an important role in triggering procentriole assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>) and, thus, uncontrolled activation may impose risks of abnormal procentriole growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Habedanck et al., 2005</xref>). Under this circumstance, Plk4 activity may call for scrupulous counterbalance by Cdc14B-like phosphatases, though centrosomal substrates of Plk4 and Cdc14B remain unknown and the consensus phosphorylation motif of Plk4 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leung et al., 2007</xref>) may not conform to a typical Ser/Thr-proline motif of Cdc14B substrates.</p><p>Cdc14B has been implicated in the regulation of nuclear structure maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nalepa and Harper, 2004</xref>), microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2005</xref>), mitotic exit control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dryden et al., 2003</xref>), and G1 progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rodier et al., 2008</xref>). The abnormal centrosome amplification observed in Cdc14B-depleted cells may arise from the combinatorial events involving failures in nuclear structure, cell, and centrosome cycle regulation. However, because active Cdc14B can directly inhibit unscheduled centriole overduplication, and Cdc14B depletion leads to centriole amplification in the absence of obvious polyploidy in normal human fibroblast cells, it is possible that one of Cdc14B functions is to serve as a centrosomal regulatory protein, and compromising centrosomal regulatory function of Cdc14B may account for at least part of the observed centriole amplification phenotype. Because it is frequently down-regulated in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martinez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neben et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rubio-Moscardo et al., 2005</xref>), Cdc14B may function as a tumor suppressor to maintain the fidelity of the centrosome duplication cycle and genomic stability in human cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, transfection, drug treatment, and cell cycle analysis</title><p>U2OS Tet-On (BD Biosciences), HeLa, and TREx HeLa (Invitrogen) cells were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2005</xref>).
