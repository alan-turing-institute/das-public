inflammation in the vascular endothelium promotes atherogenesis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This is indirectly evidenced by the fact that several
inflammatory markers are linked to an increased risk of
atherosclerosis. High-sensitive CRP (hsCRP) has been reported to
associate with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke,
sudden death from cardiac causes, and peripheral arterial disease
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, hsCRP has been shown to predict the first
cardiovascular event better than low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Recruitment of inflammatory cells
from the circulation and their transendothelial migration is one
of the earliest phases of atherogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Vascular
endothelium expresses cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) in
response to several inflammatory stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The evidence
for the role of CAMs in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has
emerged from experimental studies which have demonstrated the
focal expression of adhesion molecules in atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].
</p><p>Different CAMs have various functions in the vasculature.
Selectins and their ligands are involved in the first steps in
leukocyte adhesion at sites of endothelial injury as they mediate
the rolling and tethering of leukocytes in the
vascular wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
(VCAM-1) induce firm adhesion of inflammatory cells to the
vascular surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Overall, both soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1)
and soluble VCAM-1 (sVCAM-1) have been linked to increase risk of
atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is secreted from hepatocytes
and macrophages. ApoE is transported in lipoproteins, and it
regulates the hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins and
facilitates cholesterol efflux from foam cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In
addition, apoE has a central role in inflammation and in mediating
the central nervous system response to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].
There are three common ApoE isoforms, designated E2, E3, and E4,
which are encoded for by distinct alleles on human chromosome 19.
ApoE isoforms are distributed in six different phenotypes E2/2,
E2/3, E3/3, E4/2, E4/3, and E4/4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The presence of E4
isoform is associated with coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and
with the early onset of Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>So far, there are sparse data on apoE polymorphism in relation to
the parameters of inflammation. M&#x000e4;ntt&#x000e4;ri et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]
showed that dyslipidemic men with E4/4, E4/3, and E4/2 phenotypes
exhibit lower CRP values than men carrying other apoE phenotypes.
In a recent report by M&#x000e4;rz
et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], carriers of apoE2 allele and apoE3/3
homozygotes had significantly higher CRP than individuals with the
genotypes apoE3/4 and apoE4/4. In dyslipidemic men and women,
C-reactive protein has been reported to be lower in subjects with one or two copies of E4 allele than in
those with zero E4 allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Paradoxically,
E4 allele has been associated with an
enhanced inflammatory reaction after cardiopulmonary bypass
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In line, transgenic mice expressing the
E4 allele had greater systemic and brain
elevations of proinflammatory cytokines than
E3 carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesize that the apoE phenotype, as a critical component in
inflammatory processes, may influence the levels of inflammation
markers. HDL has been demonstrated to exhibit antiinflammatory
properties by inhibiting cytokine induced expression of adhesion
molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast, acute inflammation process
may decrease HDL concentration and thus compromise its
antiatherogenic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, recycling of
apoE is closely linked to HDL metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore we
studied the effects of apoE phenotype on the levels of CRP
and sCAMs on a sample of  Finnish low-HDL families and in
normolipidemic subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects and methods"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were recruited according to the study protocol
as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To identify the low-HDL
families, first degree relatives of the probands were examined.
The family members were coded as affected if their HDL-C levels
were below the 10th percentile cut-off levels. If at least two
affected subjects were identified in the family, all available
second-degree relatives and spouses were contacted and included in
the study. The blood samples for the lipid and lipoprotein
analysis were taken at the same visit as the inflammation
parameters and therefore the lipid and lipoprotein values in this
study represent the values of that visit, and not those of the
screening visit. Altogether 211 low-HDL family members and 157
normolipidemic subjects had measures of their apoE phenotype,
hsCRP, and sVCAM-1 concentrations. Seventeen low-HDL subjects had
history of CHD. The normolipidemic group comprised healthy
volunteers and normolipidemic spouses from the low-HDL families.
They were required to have no signs of CHD or diabetes, and no
lipid lowering medication. The smoking status of the patients was
categorized into current smokers and nonsmokers (including
exsmokers). Hypertension was defined as self-reported use of
antihypertensive drugs, systolic blood pressure &#x02265; 140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure &#x02265; 90 mmHg. Estrogen use was defined as any means of estrogen administration
(oral contraceptives, or oral or transdermal postmenopausal
hormone replacement therapy). Venous blood samples were collected
after overnight fasting. Serum was separated and used for the
biochemical measurements. Lipid and lipoprotein measurements were
done from serum as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Serum levels of
sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and sE-selectin were measured by using
commercially available monoclonal antibody-based ELISAs (R &#x00026; D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Serum highly sensitive CRP (hsCRP)
was determined by a commercial kit from Medix Biochemica,
Kauniainen, Finland. Subjects with CRP levels over 10 mg/l
were excluded. ApoE phenotype was determined by the method of
Havekes et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Statistical comparisons of clinical and
biochemical parameters were performed with SPSS 11.0 for Windows
(SPSS Inc., Chigaco, IL, USA). Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard error of mean (SEM). Continuous variables
were compared between two groups by Student <italic>t</italic> test. Variables
with nonnormal distribution were <mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02061;</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>-transformed before comparison. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05 was considered to be significant (two-tailed).
The frequency distribution between the groups was compared with
the Chi-square test. The correlation coefficients between the
biochemical and clinical characteristics were examined by
Pearson's correlation for continuous variables. Multiple
regression analysis was performed to determine the relative
contribution of different variables to hsCRP and sVCAM-1 values.
In the low-HDL group, the subjects came from 47 different
families. Ten families had only one subject, and five families had
11&#x02013;16 subjects. Because the subjects in the present cohort were
not independent, we used the family number (which indicates
belonging to a certain family) as a random variable.
Family-number-adjusted residuals of log CRP and log VCAM were used
in the multiple regression model for low-HDL family members. Since
control subjects were not related, the family-number adjustment
was performed only in the low-HDL group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The effects of apoE phenotype was studied by dividing subjects
into two subgroups (apoE groups): into the E3 group, which
included E3/2 and E3/3 phenotypes, and into the E4 group which
included E4/2, E4/3, and E4/4 phenotypes. Clinical and biochemical
characteristics of the study subjects are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows that serum hsCRP values were
significantly lower in the E4 than in the E3 subgroup both in the
low-HDL group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01) and in the normolipidemic group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05)
after adjustment for age, BMI, serum apoA-I, apoA-II, apoB, HDL-C,
LDL-C, triglycerides, smoking status, hypertension, and gender in
normolipidemic subjects, and after additional adjustment for
family number in the low-HDL group. The concentration of serum
sVCAM-1 was significantly lower in the E4 group than in the E3
group in low-HDL subjects (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01) but the significance
disappeared after adjustment for family number (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Multiple regression analysis revealed that
apoE phenotype was a significant predictor of serum hsCRP values both in
low-HDL and normolipidemic subjects (<italic>P</italic> = .023 and <italic>P</italic> = .011, resp)
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Estrogen used was also a strong
predictor of serum hsCRP concentration in low-HDL subjects
(<italic>P</italic> = .026) as well as in normolpidemic subjects (<italic>P</italic> = .036) 
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>)</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The major finding of the present study is that subjects presenting
the apoE4 allele have decreased levels of
serum hsCRP. This is an interesting observation, since ApoE plays
a central role in inflammation and atherosclerosis. ApoE knockout
mice are especially prone to atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and to die
from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. ApoE
participates in cholesterol efflux, and has been observed to be
recycled from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins into HDL-particles
 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In mice, exogenous apoE injection has been
demonstrated to decrease the LPS-induced production of
proinflammatory cytokines, probable by decreasing the release of
cytokines from macrophages, which was accompanied by reduced
mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. CRP and apoE concentrations are inversely
related in obese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, human CRP
transgene expression has been shown to cause accelerated
atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].
Thus, according to these studies, the role of apoE in inflammation
and atherosclerosis may be protective.</p><p>Despite the importance of apoE in the inflammatory process, only
few studies have linked apoE polymorphisms to inflammatory
parameters. In the central nervous system, apoE4 has been reported
to be less effective than apoE3 or apoE2 at suppressing the
activation of microglia in cell culture models of brain
inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Transgenic mice expressing the apoE4
allele have significantly greater systemic and brain elevations of
proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 as compared with
their apoE3 counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study, the
hsCRP concentration was significantly lower in subjects exhibiting
apoE4 allele than in those exhibiting other alleles.
Likewise, M&#x000e4;ntt&#x000e4;ri and associates demonstrated, in a
population of 179 dyslipidemic Finnish men, that subjects with
apoE4/3 phenotype had lower mean CRP concentration than those
with apoE3/3 phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In Japanese Americans, CRP
values have been reported to be significantly higher in
apoE2 carriers than in apoE3 or
apoE4 carriers, and similar between apoE3 and
apoE4 carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In line with the Japanese
data, German patients with or without coronary heart disease also
showed higher CRP values in apoE2 carriers than in
apoE3/4 heterozygotes or in apoE4/4 homozygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].
However, CRP was also significantly higher in apoE3/3 homozygotes
than in apoE3/4 heterozygotes or in apoE4/4 homozygotes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Similarly, in the Cardiovascular Health Study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], CRP values were lower in apoE4
positive than in apoE4 negative
individuals independently of the amount of used alcohol. Thus, the
present data extend these previous observations to a cohort of
low-HDL family members as well as to normolipidemic subjects.</p><p>The mechanisms behind low serum CRP values in
apoE4 carriers in this study, and in
previous works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] are unclear. Since apoE
phenotype remained as a predictor of hsCRP in multiple regression
model, the difference between apoE4 and apoE3 groups can not be
explained by confounding factors, such as estrogen use. One
explanation, originally suggested by M&#x000e4;rz and associates
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], could be that the metabolism of CRP is related to
mevalonate pathway. In carriers of apoE4,
the mevalonate pathway may be down-regulated resulting in
decreased CRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The observed low serum CRP values in apoE4
carriers in the present study, and reportedly low CRP values in
apoE4 carriers in previous works
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], are perplexing findings since
apoE4 allele is associated to an increased
risk of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, in the present study,
the low-HDL family members within the E4 group had an atherogenic
lipid profile: they had higher concentrations of apoB, a trend for
higher serum triglycerides, and lower concentration of HDL-C as
compared with the E3 group. Thus, the changes in lipoproteins
rather than changes in inflammatory parameters may explain the
atherogenity of apoE4 allele.</p><p>We conclude that apoE phenotype has a strong influence on
C-reactive protein. ApoE may be a double-faced protein having
different actions in lipid metabolism and inflammation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank all the study subjects for participating in this study.
