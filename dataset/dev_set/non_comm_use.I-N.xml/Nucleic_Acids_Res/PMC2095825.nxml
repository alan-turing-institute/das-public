In yeast, two genes are autoregulated by feedback effects of the protein on pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we have investigated whether similar mechanisms occur in eukaryotes with more complicated and highly regulated splicing patterns. Comparisons of the sequences of ribosomal protein S13 gene (<italic>RPS13</italic>) among mammals and birds revealed that intron 1 is more conserved than the other introns. Transfection of HEK 293 cells with a minigene-expressing ribosomal protein S13 showed that the presence of intron 1 reduced expression by a factor of four. Ribosomal protein S13 was found to inhibit excision of intron 1 from rpS13 pre-mRNA fragment <italic>in vitro</italic>. This protein was shown to be able to specifically bind the fragment and to confer protection against ribonuclease cleavage at sequences near the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites. The results suggest that overproduction of rpS13 in mammalian cells interferes with splicing of its own pre-mRNA by a feedback mechanism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Apart from their functions in ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) and mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), many ribosomal proteins are involved in a variety of extraribosomal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). There are 79 different mammalian ribosomal proteins, 34 of which have bacterial counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Human ribosomal protein genes are distributed widely through the genome and, except for ribosomal protein (rp) S4, each protein is encoded by a single gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The level of expression of these genes depends on various factors such as the cell type, the phase of the cell cycle, ambient conditions, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Fine regulation of ribosomal protein biosynthesis is necessary for the vitality of individual cells and whole organisms, and impairments of this regulation may lead to critical consequences such as malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), developmental malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and so on.</p><p>It is known that the expression of ribosomal protein genes in eukaryotes can be regulated at the levels of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In addition, the content of ribosomal proteins in eukaryotic cells is controlled via changes in the degradation rate of newly synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The transcriptional and translational levels of the regulation are coordinated by common regulatory elements in the genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) of ribosomal proteins. The regulation of ribosomal protein biosynthesis at the splicing level is less well documented. In yeast, at least two genes are regulated via a feedback mechanism in which ribosomal proteins bind their own pre-mRNAs, preventing their splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). As for humans, indications for the regulation of expression via splicing were recently obtained for two rp genes. So, we demonstrated that rpS26 suppresses splicing of its own pre-mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Binding of this protein to its cognate pre-mRNA may prevent the recognition of the splicing signals by components of the splicing machinery and thus interfere with spliceosome assembly. However, whether rpS26 biosynthesis is regulated this way <italic>in vivo</italic> is still unknown. A similar pathway may be realized in the regulation of human rpL3 biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It was shown that rpL3 overexpression caused an increase in its aberrantly spliced mRNA that contained intron 3 and was degraded by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). A similar aberrantly spliced isoform of mRNA containing unremoved intron 1 was found also for rpL12 from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, a direct implication of rpL3 and rpL12 in their biosynthesis regulation was not proven.</p><p>Autoregulation appears to be a potent mechanism by which the level of each individual ribosomal protein in the cell could be controlled independently, which may be crucial for the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins. To test this possibility further, we have examined human rpS13. This protein is a homologue of prokaryotic rpS15, which binds to the central domain of the 16S rRNA and promotes the binding of neighbouring proteins in the 30S ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Its yeast counterpart is indispensable for the initial stage of pre-18S rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The extraribosomal functions of human rpS13 are still unclear; nevertheless there are data suggesting that rpS13 (along with rpL23) promotes multidrug resistance in gastric cancer cells by suppressing drug-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Remarkably, of the 17 human EST records containing the sequence corresponding to RPS13 intron 1 in GenBank, at least two (GenBank accession no CD050699 and BI756632) are derived from rpS13 mRNA containing retained intron 1. This suggested to us that the protein might be involved in autoregulation of its expression via splicing, so we have tested this possibility both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>In the current study we have analysed the extent of conservation of intron 1 within <italic>RPS13</italic> gene in mammals and examined role of human rpS13 in its own gene expression regulation. Our first results showed that the presence of the first intron in an rpS13 minigene reduced the level of mRNA expressed in cell culture. The possibility that there was a protein-dependent inhibition of splicing was confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing experiments. Remarkably, the rpS13-binding sites on the pre-mRNA turned out to be located closely to the splice sites that allowed us to suggest a feedback mechanism for the <italic>RPS13</italic> gene expression regulation at the splicing step.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>PCR and plasmid constructions</title><p>DNA sequences containing a coding part of rpS13 cDNA were PCR amplified using total HeLa cDNA and a pair of primers, S13F and S13R.

The first construction (pECFP-S13) contained the coding part of rpS13 cDNA inserted into the vector pECFP-N1 in frame with the eCFP gene. The second construction (pECFP-S13-int1) was similar to pECFP-S13 but contained RPS13 intron 1 inserted in the coding part of rpS13 cDNA between sequences corresponding to exons 1 and 2. As a control, cells were transfected with the original vector pECFP-N1. The rpS13-eCFP fusion protein produced in the cells transfected with pECFP-S13 and pECFP-S13-int1 was nuclear and nucleolar, as expected for ribosomal proteins overexpressed in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The relative amount of the mRNA coding for rpS13 (both endogenous and plasmid derived) in the cell culture was determined by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). As expected, the levels of rpS13 mRNA in the cell cultures treated with plasmids coding for rpS13 (either pECFP-S13 or pECFP-S13-int1) were much higher than in the cell cultures treated with the original vector or in the untreated culture. It means that in the cells transfected with plasmids coding for rpS13, the pool of mRNA coding for rpS13 consists largely of the plasmid-derived mRNA. Remarkably, the level of rpS13 mRNA in cells transfected with pECFP-S13-int1 was about four times less than that in the cells transfected with the intronless construction pECFP-S13, even though the levels of GAPDH mRNA were about the same. The result is consistent with the hypothesis that rpS13 might regulate the level of protein expression via feedback on splicing and it suggests that the target is intron 1, while the result does not exclude both other intron-dependent mechanisms and possible effect of rpS13 on splicing of some other pre-mRNAs.

The addition of increasing concentrations of rpS13 to reaction mixtures containing both the pre-mRNAs caused complete inhibition of splicing of S13INT at a protein concentration of 8 &#x003bc;M, whereas the suppression of splicing of the non-cognate rpS16 pre-mRNA was much weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The non-cognate ribosomal proteins rpS10 and rpS16 barely affected S13INT splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).

RNA footprints detect either the direct protection of phosphodiester bonds by the bound protein or rearrangements of the RNA spatial structure caused by protein binding. A prediction of the S13INT secondary structure using Sfold 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sfold.wadsworth.org/index.pl">http://sfold.wadsworth.org/index.pl</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) revealed that folded S13INT represents an ensemble of molecules with similar tightly folded structures formed with several extended stems and few loops. An ensemble centroid with a minimum free energy (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sub>37</sub>) equal to &#x02212;88.5 kcal/mol is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A. Taking into account the high (65%) GC-content of the S13INT sequence, we infer that a structure at least similar to this would be formed by pre-mRNA before addition to nuclear extract. Therefore, we carried out footprinting of free RNA and the RNA in the binary complex (rpS13 &#x02022; S13INT) under conditions when more than 90% of the RNA was bound to the protein. Three RNases, T1, T2 and V1, were employed in the experiments. The positions of cleavages identified by primer extension analysis using two different primers are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B. The footprinting data generally supported the secondary structure proposed for S13INT. Seven phosphodiester bonds within S13INT changed their accessibility to RNases due to rpS13 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Two of them (cleavages 5&#x02032; to C46 and G53) are located in the vicinity of the 5&#x02032; splice site, another two (cleavages 5&#x02032; to A192 and G193) are close to the 3&#x02032; splice site and three sites (cleavages 5&#x02032; to C76 and to neighbouring residues C162 and A164) are intronic, somewhat distant from the splice sites.

The affinity of rpS13 for S13INTm was substantially smaller than that for S13INT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D), indicating that the mutations really disturbed the protein-binding site. S13INTm was reactive in splicing <italic>in vitro</italic> and it generated the same splicing pattern as S13INT, but it was less sensitive to inhibition by rpS13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). These results suggest that rpS13 inhibits splicing of its own pre-mRNA due to its binding close to the splicing sites in intron 1.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Ribosomal proteins are very abundant cellular proteins that are capable of binding to different RNA species. Recent investigations have demonstrated that eukaryotic ribosomal proteins are associated with newly transcribed RNA Pol II transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Thus, the presence of 27 ribosomal proteins in sites of active transcription in <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland cells was shown by means of chromosomal immunostaining and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Method of chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that ribosomal proteins in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> associate with nascent RNP complexes within nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Ribosomal proteins were also found in spliceosomal complexes in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Although, it was assumed in these cases that nascent transcripts were bound non-specifically, the example of human rpS13 suggests that there are also specific interactions between ribosomal proteins and their pre-mRNAs that may have functional significance.</p><p>Earlier, it was shown that introns in a few eukaryotic ribosomal protein genes participate in regulation of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). These introns, as a rule, are short and bear conserved regulatory elements. Our search of the <italic>RPS13</italic> gene demonstrated that intron 1 is conserved within the genomes of higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This is consistent with a role in the regulation of expression.</p><p>The constructions pECFP-S13 and pECFP-S13-int1 used for the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments differed in the presence of intron 1 of <italic>RPS13</italic> gene in the latter construction. Cells transfected with pECFP-S13-int1 overproduced rpS13-eCFP fusion protein, indicating that splicing of the premature transcript produced from pECFP-S13-int1 was correct. The 4-fold decrease in rpS13 mRNA as compared with those in the cells transfected with pECFP-S13 suggested a connection between the presence of intron 1 in the premature transcript and the level of rpS13 mRNA in the cells. One possibility is that rpS13 inhibited splicing of intron 1, decreasing the total rpS13 mRNA level in the transfected cells. However, other intron-dependent pathways remained possible too; one example might be targeting by rpS13 of nuclease activity to the pre-mRNA. Due to its high positive charge, rpS13, like other ribosomal proteins, would be expected to bind readily to RNA. Actually, the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays showed that rpS13 was able to bind to non-cognate pre-RNAs, but this binding was much weaker than its binding to cognate pre-mRNA containing intron 1. Moreover, rpS13 was able to inhibit splicing <italic>in vitro</italic> of this fragment, whereas other ribosomal proteins did not do so; at the same time, rpS13 had little effect on the splicing of non-cognate pre-mRNAs. Hence, it seemed probable that rpS13 would interact with regions in the pre-mRNA that are necessary for splicing.</p><p>The footprinting experiments with S13INT in the complex with rpS13 revealed changes in accessibility to RNases for several internucleotide phosphodiester bonds that are located both in regions of the RNA close to 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites and in the vicinity of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Taking into account that ribosomal proteins upon their binding to rRNA, as a rule, do not introduce major changes into its structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) we consider it more likely that the footprints arose from protein binding rather than from S13INT structural rearrangements. Either the regions of S13INT containing the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites are spatially drawn together and form the rpS13-binding site or several protein molecules bind to different splice sites.</p><p>Although, the binding sites for rpS13 have not been determined, its prokaryotic homologue, rpS15, has been shown to recognize RNA structure rather than specific sequences. In particular, it recognizes on 16S rRNA an imperfect double helix with a three-way junction at its base and G-U/G-C base pairs separated from the junction by one helical turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Remarkably, the region recognized in S13INTby rpS13 contains a helix formed by nucleotides from 39 to 64, with base pairs G48&#x02013;U55 and G49&#x02013;C54 approximately one turn from the RNA three-way junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The 5&#x02032; splice site in S13INT is located within this helix. Moreover, we found that disruption of this helix structure by mutations in positions 44&#x02013;46 (together with mutations in positions 191&#x02013;193) reduces the rpS13 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). The similarity with the binding site of rpS15 is consistent with the possibility that the footprints (at least close to the 5&#x02032; splice site) arose from rpS13 binding to corresponding sites in S13INT.</p><p>Our findings suggest that the inhibition of splicing of the rpS13 pre-mRNA by an increase in rpS13 concentration results from the binding of rpS13 to the pre-mRNA near the splicing signals within intron 1. The consequences of this binding for splicing reactions are unknown. However, if splicing of intron 1 is blocked, intron-retaining RNA may be formed, as described for some other eukaryotic ribosomal protein mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and it may be degraded by NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Such a mechanism is likely to work most efficiently with terminal introns adjacent to short terminal exons, in which impediments to splicing are to lead to either skipping or the activation of cryptic sites. Interestingly, both <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) rpS15 proteins have a regulatory function. The latter binds to its own mRNA and represses its own translation by a feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>).
<fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of possible pathways for autoregulation of the biosynthesis of rpS13 via splicing of intron 1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm701f6"/></fig></p><p>The autoregulation of expression by eukaryotic ribosomal proteins appears to operate by a variety of mechanisms. Thus, rpL12 of <italic>C. elegans</italic> inhibits constitutive splicing of its own pre-mRNA and stimulates alternative splicing in intron 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), whereas human rpS26 inhibited both constitutive and alternative splicing of its intron 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). A rise in ribosomal protein L1 concentration in oocytes of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> leads to the formation and rapid degradation of rpL1 mRNA isoforms containing unremoved introns 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), and rpL30 of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> inhibits not only splicing of its own pre-mRNA by binding to the intron, but also translation of its own mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Feedback autoregulation may have evolved independently for some or all ribosomal proteins, but it would be unsurprising if the major process subject to regulation was splicing. The subtlety and complexity of splicing suggest that the process might be unusually delicate and susceptible to perturbation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by grant from the Russian Fund for Basic Research (No. 05-04-48393-a), grant from Siberian Brunch of the Russian Academy of Sciences for young scientist projects competition in honour of M.A. Lavrentiev (No. 92) to A.V.I. and EMBO Short Term Fellowship (ASTF 8-2005) to A.A.M.
