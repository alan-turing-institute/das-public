The nucleosome core is formed by an octamer comprised of two copies of each histone protein, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, around which 145&#x02013;147&#x02009;bp of DNA is wrapped twice. Appropriate levels of histone expression are critical for transcription, chromosome segregation, repair, and other chromatin-mediated processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Histone genes are highly reiterated and are often organized into clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). For example, the majority of human histone genes are located in major and minor clusters on chromosomes 6p21 and 1q21, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), while the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, contains two copies of each pair of H2A-H2B and H3-H4 histone genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The fission yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, investigated in the present study also has reiterated histone genes, the genomic organization of which consists of a single H2A&#x003b2; (<italic>hta2<sup>+</sup></italic>), a pair of H2A&#x003b1;-H2B (<italic>hta1<sup>+</sup>-htb1<sup>+</sup></italic>), and three pairs of H3-H4 (<italic>hht1<sup>+</sup></italic>-<italic>hhf1<sup>+</sup></italic>, <italic>hht2<sup>+</sup></italic>-<italic>hhf2<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>hht3<sup>+</sup></italic>-<italic>hhf3<sup>+</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The amino acid sequences deduced from three copies of histone H3 genes or those of histone H4 genes are identical, while the two predicted H2A proteins differ by three amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Although the repetitive nature of the histone genes in the genome appears to be evolutionarily well conserved, its physiological significance remains obscure.</p><p>Histone production is up-regulated at S-phase coinciding with nucleosome assembly during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In S-phase, DNA synthesis and histone synthesis are highly regulated in a coordinated and concerted manner. For example, in both yeast and higher eukaryotes, interference with DNA replication by genotoxic agents triggers repression of histone gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Conversely, in human cells, the reduction of histone transcription by ectopic overproduction of a histone repressor leads to concerted blockage of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In budding yeast, although DNA replication occurs in the absence of histone synthesis, passage through S-phase results in severe loss of cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The increased histone synthesis during S-phase is due to regulation at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In higher eukaryotes, although such transcriptional regulation contributes to several-fold increases in histone synthesis during S-phase, the majority is likely due to post-transcriptional regulation of histone mRNA processing and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The up-regulation of histone synthesis in budding yeast is thought to be achieved through both repression in G1- and G2-phases and transcriptional activation just before entry into S-phase. Each of the budding yeast histone gene pairs is transcribed in divergent orientation from common regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), including upstream activator sequence repeats and a negative repressor element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Although transcriptional activation at S-phase is a common feature of the histone genes conserved among species, it remains unclear whether conserved molecules are involved in the activation.</p><p>HIRA proteins are members of an evolutionarily highly conserved family of histone chaperones that have been implicated in nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). HIRA proteins were originally discovered as repressors of histone gene expression outside S-phase or in response to HU, an inhibitor of DNA replication in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Two HIRA proteins, Hir1 and Hir2, restrict the expression of six of the eight core histone genes at S-phase in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The fission yeast also has two related HIRA proteins, Slm9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and Hip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), whereas higher eukaryotes have only a single protein. In higher eukaryotes, HIRA has been identified as a critical component of a replication-independent nucleosome deposition pathway as a chaperone for histone octamers containing the H3.3 variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). HIRA is also involved in transcriptional regulation, as over-expression of HIRA in human cells in tissue culture results in histone gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). It remains to be determined whether and how these two activities are functionally related.</p><p>Histone genes can be classified into three main subtypes based on their expression pattern and genomic organization: replication-dependent, replication- and cell cycle phase-independent, and tissue-specific histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Higher eukaryotes, including humans, have three H3 histone variants, H3.1, H3.2 and H3.3. The major H3 histones, H3.1 and H3.2, have only a single amino acid difference, and are synthesized and deposited on DNA strictly during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). H3.3 differs from H3.2&#x02009;in five amino acids in humans and is synthesized and deposited on DNA throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Interestingly, observations in flies and humans indicate that H3.3 is associated with transcriptionally active gene loci and is enriched in covalent modifications associated with gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In contrast, H3.2 has been shown to be enriched in markers associated with gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The transcriptional state at the loci may be a critical determinant for H3.3 deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In contrast, yeasts have only a single H3 protein; the budding yeast genome possesses only H3.3-type histone genes, while the fission yeast H3 genes encode an identical hybrid protein exhibiting characteristics of both H3.3 and H3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we characterized the transcriptional properties of individual histone H3 and H4 genes throughout the cell cycle using the genetically tractable model organism, <italic>S. pombe</italic>. The DNA sequences of reiterated histone genes within the coding region in <italic>S. pombe</italic> show significant identity among the copies, while the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-untranslated regions (UTRs) show divergence. Hereafter, we refer to the three pairs of H3-H4 genes (<italic>hht1<sup>+</sup></italic>-<italic>hhf1<sup>+</sup></italic>, <italic>hht2<sup>+</sup></italic>-<italic>hhf2<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>hht3<sup>+</sup></italic>-<italic>hhf3<sup>+</sup></italic>) as copy-1, -2 and -3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method with allele-specific probes was used for precise comparison of the relative levels of transcripts derived from reiterated histone genes among wild-type, histone gene deletion mutants, and mutants in which histone transcription is compromised. We identified Ams2, a cell cycle-regulated GATA-type transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), as an activator of core histone genes at S-phase. Ams2 protein has a zinc finger motif that is characteristic of the family of GATA-type transcription factors, some of which have been reported to bind to GATA-containing DNA consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Indeed, Ams2 has been shown to exhibit DNA-binding activity to a GATA sequence <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Ams2 accumulates on the nuclear chromatin when chromosomes are duplicated during S-phase, whereas little accumulation of this protein was detected in mid-to-late G2 or early M-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The results of the present study indicated the differential transcriptional regulation of three histone gene pairs, which is probably controlled by a combination of Ams2-dependent transcriptional activation at S-phase and Ams2-independent constitutive transcription throughout the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>General techniques, antibodies and strains</title><p>The general techniques and media used for manipulation of fission yeast were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). &#x003b1;-Ams2 polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with GST-tagged Ams2 and affinity purified. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> lists the genotypes of the strains used in this study. To construct an Ams2-depleted mutant strain, a linearized DNA fragment containing the Ams2-coding region, in which the 2.3-kb <italic>Nhe</italic>I-<italic>Nco</italic>I fragment was replaced with a KanMX marker, was integrated into the genome by selecting G418-resistant transformants.

To construct mutant strains lacking one pair of histone H3 and H4, a PCR-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) was used to replace copy-1, -2 and -3 with KanMX, hphMX and NAT markers, respectively (<italic>&#x00394;1</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;hht1<sup>+</sup>-hhf1<sup>+</sup></italic>; <italic>&#x00394;2</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;hht2<sup>+</sup>-hhf2<sup>+</sup></italic>; <italic>&#x00394;3</italic>, <italic>&#x00394;hht3<sup>+</sup>-hhf3<sup>+</sup></italic>, respectively).

To obtain insight into the action of Ams2&#x02009;in SpCENP-A localization at the molecular level, we examined the transcriptional targets of Ams2. The transcription factor Ams2 was originally identified as one of four multicopy suppressors in the SpCENP-A ts mutant <italic>cnp1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Ams2 is dispensable for cell viability, but Ams2-depletion results in growth retardation with a high frequency of chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In addition to <italic>ams2<sup>+</sup></italic>, three genomic histone H4 genes act as suppressor genes for <italic>cnp1-1</italic>, and ectopic over-expression of H4, but not other histones, results in partial amelioration of the growth retardation seen in Ams2-null cells (see Figure S1A in the Supplementary Data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Thus, as demonstrated in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), the availability of H4-SpCENP-A dimers may cause defective SpCENP-A incorporation, leading to growth defects in <italic>&#x00394;ams2</italic> cells. Therefore, in the present study, we examined whether Ams2 regulates histone transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Synchronous cultures of wild-type and Ams2-deficient cells were prepared by centrifugal elutriation, and the cell extracts were analyzed by northern and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Ams2 transcription is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, which is similar to G1-specific Mrc1 transcription in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>); the promoter of the <italic>ams2<sup>+</sup></italic> gene has an <italic>Mlu</italic>I cell-cycle box 1 (MCB1) motif, genes carrying which are known to be regulated by MCB binding factor (MBF), a conserved transcription complex (Cdc10-Res1-Res2-Rep2&#x02009;in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) that functions in G1-S progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Many of the genes required for S-phase functions, such as <italic>mrc1<sup>+</sup></italic> (which encodes a protein required for DNA replication checkpoint), <italic>cdc18<sup>+</sup></italic> (which encodes a protein that couples cell cycle signals to the DNA replication machinery and induces replication), and <italic>cdc22<sup>+</sup></italic> (which encodes a ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase large chain), contain an MBF1 motif in their promoters and are regulated simultaneously at G1-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Ams2 protein level also oscillates through the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), reaching a peak concomitant with S-phase-specific Sap1 transcription and histone gene activation in S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In Ams2-deficient cells, although the basal level of transcription of histone genes was the same as that in wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), timely accumulation of core histone mRNAs (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) during DNA synthesis was markedly suppressed. The division cycle in Ams2-null cells is longer than that in wild-type cells; maximal septation index is seen at 90&#x02009;min in wild-type cells, but does not peak until &#x0223c;150&#x02009;min in the Ams2-null mutant. Given the lack of available core histones with which to form nucleosomes, the longer generation time of Ams2-null cells could be due to a significant delay of DNA replication. However, flow cytometric analysis indicated that Ams2-null cells duplicated their DNA when they formed septa, similarly to the wild-type control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). No significant delay was observed in DNA replication in Ams2-depleted cells in which S-phase-specific activation of histone genes was blocked. The observation that DNA replication in <italic>&#x00394;ams2</italic> cells, which were released from S-phase-arrest caused by addition of HU, proceeds without a significant delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) also supported this conclusion. These results indicated that although Ams2-depletion affects the duration of the cell cycle, the reason for which remains unclear, blockade of histone gene activation has no marked effect on DNA replication. The S-phase-specific transcription of <italic>sap1<sup>+</sup></italic>, as well as other phase-specific cell cycle markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), was preserved in Ams2-depleted cells. However, it should be noted that the progression of S-phase (the beginning of the expression of at least a portion of S-phase-specific genes) may be delayed to some extent in the <italic>ams2</italic> shut-off strain, although the extension of the cell cycle duration is still much longer than this delay; in Ams2-depleted cells, the peak of expression of the S-phase-specific marker, Sap1 (180&#x02013;195&#x02009;min after release), occurs 30&#x02013;45&#x02009;min later than the peak of the septation index (150&#x02009;min after release), while these peaks are roughly coincident with each other in wild-type cells at 90&#x02009;min. In both wild-type and Ams2-depleted cells, the timing of the end of expression of the G1 specific-marker, Mrc1 and the beginning of the expression of the G2 specific-marker, Spd1, are coincident with the peak of the septation index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), suggesting that cell cycle events other than expression of some S-phase-specific genes occur normally in Ams2-depleted cells.

The <italic>cdc25-22</italic> mutant strain was used to synchronize <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells; G2-arrested cells were prepared by inactivating Cdc25 phosphatase, an inducer of mitosis, at the restrictive temperature of 36&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02009;h. Cells were then released synchronously into mitosis at 26&#x000b0;C. As most fission yeast cells with a septum are in S-phase, the septation index (i.e. the percentage of cells with a septum) is a good hallmark for estimating of cell synchronization. We prepared cell extracts for ChIP experiments from cell populations in late-G2 and S-phase (time 0 and 210&#x02009;min; septation indexes of 4.2 and 74.3%, respectively). Cells were treated with 3% formaldehyde for cross-link of DNAs with the binding proteins. After sonication, DNAs co-immunoprecipitated with &#x003b1;-Ams2 polyclonal antibodies were purified and quantified by real-time PCR using the probes indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A. In S-phase cells, the ChIP signals were detected using primers derived from the intergenic regions between <italic>H3<sup>+</sup>-H4<sup>+</sup></italic> pairs (probes 3, 4 and 5), the intergenic region between the <italic>hta1<sup>+</sup>-htb1<sup>+</sup></italic> pair (probe 1), and the upstream region of the <italic>hta2<sup>+</sup></italic> gene (probe 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).

GFP-specific primers were used for real-time PCR amplification to estimate the amounts of DNA co-immunoprecipitated using &#x003b1;-Ams2 polyclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, center panel). The <italic>Mlu</italic>I-<italic>Pst</italic>I 281&#x02009;bp DNA fragment in the middle of the intergenic region was shown to be essential for Ams2 binding. This region contains a so-called &#x02018;AACCCT-box&#x02019; consensus sequence, which consists of a 17-bp sequence (5&#x02032;-ATCA(C/A)AACCCTAACCCT-3&#x02032;) commonly present upstream of histone genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, left).

The promoter region lacking the AACCCT-box (&#x00394;C) showed complete loss of Ams2-binding activity, indicating that Ams2 binds upstream of the core histone genes during S-phase in an AACCCT-box-dependent manner. To determine whether Ams2 binding actually activates transcription of the histone genes, we next examined expression of the GFP gene under the control of the <italic>hht1<sup>+</sup></italic> promoter by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in the panel on the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, the promoter constructs to which Ams2 cannot bind (YTP761 and YTP760) lost the ability to promote transcription of the GFP reporter gene. Importantly, the transcriptional level of the GFP gene in the &#x00394;C construct was comparable to that of the control GFP gene without the promoter (YTP779). These observations strongly suggest that S-phase-specific histone activation is promoted by direct association of Ams2 with the histone promoters through the AACCCT-box.</p><p>Next, a BLAST homology search was performed using the fission yeast chromosome and mitochondrial genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genedb.org/genedb/pombe/blast.jsp">http://www.genedb.org/genedb/pombe/blast.jsp</ext-link>) to find the sequences matching 100% to a 17-bp AACCCT-box-motif sequence (5&#x02032;-ATCA(C/A)AACCCTAACCCT-3&#x02032;). Only one additional sequence that shows 100% identical to the consensus was found &#x0223c;0.9&#x02009;kb upstream of the SPAC631.02 gene besides those on histone promoters. Intriguingly, this ORF is reported to be transcribed at S/G2-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) and encodes a protein containing two bromodomains, which recognize acetylated lysine residues on the N-termini of histones.

We performed ChIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B) and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the SPAC631.02 gene to determine whether Ams2 binds to the upstream region and regulates transcription of this gene. The amplified ChIP signal obtained using a primer set derived from the genomic region adjacent to the AACCCT-box located upstream of the SPAC631.02 gene (probe 9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) was detected reproducibly in the DNAs co-immunoprecipitated with Ams2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The ChIP signal was increased in S-phase samples, implying that the SPAC631.02 gene may be a physiological transcriptional target of Ams2&#x02009;in addition to the core histone genes. The physiological significance of the binding of Ams2 to the upstream region of the SPAC631.02 gene at S-phase remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Properties of transcriptional oscillation of three pairs of histone H3 and H4 genes</title><p>The fission yeast genome has three pairs of histone H3-H4 genes (copy-1, -2 and -3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Although the total amounts of histone H3- and H4-transcripts have been reported to be increased in S-phase during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), the transcriptional profiles of each of the histone H3 and H4 genes have yet to be defined. To determine the individual transcriptional patterns, allele-specific probes for each of the three copies of the H3 and H4 genes were designed for northern blotting analysis. As the three histone H3- or H4-ORFs show 88&#x02013;93% identities at the nucleotide sequence level, the DNA probes derived from the ORF regions could not distinguish individual H3 or H4 transcripts on northern blotting analysis. Therefore, we designed DNA probes based on the sequences outside the ORFs that exhibit lower levels of similarity to each other. We identified UTRs of the three histone H3 and H4 genes using a combination of 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-RACE methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>S, see Materials and Methods section). We verified that the transcripts of different sizes from each locus determined by the RACE methods were actually transcribed in wild-type cells; the sizes of the bands identified by northern blotting using H3 or H4 probes were approximately coincident with the sizes of the predicted transcripts taking into consideration the subsequent addition of a poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B).

Surprisingly, the transcripts deduced from copy-2 prepared from asynchronous cells were increased reproducibly in both Ams2-over-expressing and -depleted cells in comparison with wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A&#x02013;C).

This feedback control appears to function in an Ams2-independent manner.

In these cases, the increases in the levels of transcripts from copy-2 and copy-3 were prominent as compared with those from copy-1. The physiology of feedback regulation may differ between Ams2 null mutants and histone deletion mutants.</p><p>Next, we performed quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate the effects of Ams2-depletion on the transcriptional profiles of each histone gene in S-phase and G2-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) using the elutriation samples prepared for the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Cell samples were taken 90&#x02009;min after release for the wild-type strain, which were expected to be enriched in cells at S-phase. Corresponding cell samples were taken at two time points, 150 and 180&#x02009;min, for the <italic>ams2</italic> shut-off strain; under the conditions using Ams2-depleted cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the boundary between G1- and G2-phase&#x02014;and presumably DNA replication&#x02014;seemed to occur at 150&#x02013;165&#x02009;min after release, while the expression of the S-phase marker, Sap1, peaked at around 180&#x02013;195&#x02009;min. The cell samples at 30 and 165&#x02009;min for wild-type and at 60 and 240&#x02009;min for the <italic>ams2</italic> shut-off strain were used as fractions at late-G2/M-phase because these time points lie at the boundary of expression of the G2-phase marker, Spd1, and the M-phase marker, Cdc15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The results of the quantitative RT-PCR experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> clearly indicated that the levels of expression of H3 and H4 genes in copy-1 and copy-3 during S-phase in Ams2-depleted cells were decreased compared to those seen in late-G2/M-phase in wild-type cells, while the basal levels of expression of histone H3 and H4&#x02009;in copy-2&#x02009;in late-G2/M-phase were increased by 1.4- to 2.0-fold in Ams2-depleted cells as compared with wild-type controls. Therefore, the feedback up-regulation of histone H3 and H4 genes under the conditions of Ams2-depletion appeared to be achieved mainly through up-regulation of the basal expression of <italic>hht2<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>hhf2<sup>+</sup></italic>. Consistent with this suggestion, tetrad analysis indicated that copy-2 null mutant (<italic>&#x00394;2</italic>; YTP547), but not copy-1 null mutant (<italic>&#x00394;1</italic>; YTP545) or copy-3 null mutant (<italic>&#x00394;3</italic>; YTP549), was synthetic lethal with <italic>&#x00394;ams2</italic> (SP45) (Figure S3 in the Supplementary Data).</p></sec><sec><title>Fission yeast HIRA homologs are required for repression of the basal expression of copy-2 genes</title><p>In fission yeast, it has been shown that loss of Hip1, one of two homologs of the human HIRA histone chaperone, leads to derepression of core histone gene expression outside of S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Therefore, we performed quantitative RT-PCR to investigate how depletion of Hip1 (or Slm9, another homolog of HIRA) may affect the expression patterns of each histone H3 and H4 gene during the cell cycle. For these experiments, we used synchronized cells released from arrest in S-phase by transient treatment with HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The DNA contents estimated by flow cytometric analyses indicated that the cell samples 15&#x02009;min after release were in S-phase in all strains tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, left). As the septation index began to increase from 105&#x02009;min in <italic>&#x00394;slm9</italic> and 90&#x02009;min in the other strains, we selected the fraction obtained at 60&#x02009;min after release as cell samples in G2-phase.

In <italic>&#x00394;ams2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, upper right), S-phase activation of copy-1 genes was markedly suppressed, whereas the basal levels of transcription of copy-2 genes appeared to be up-regulated. However, <italic>&#x00394;ams2</italic> cells arrested by HU seemed to retain the S-phase-specific activation of copy-3 genes, which was inconsistent with our conclusions based on the results of experiments using the elutriated <italic>ams2</italic> shut-off strain shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear.</p><p>In <italic>&#x00394;hip1</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;slm9</italic> cells, we showed that the levels of transcription of histone H3 and H4 genes are up-regulated at both S- and G2-phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, lower panels). Although Hip1 and Slm9 form a large protein complex and share common functions in pericentric heterochromatin formation and faithful mitotic chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), the two proteins are not functionally equivalent; Hip1 represses the expression of core histone genes outside S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), while the pattern of H2A expression during the cell cycle remains unaffected in Slm9-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).

Hip1- or Slm9-deletion mutants showed marked transcriptional derepression of copy-2 genes, suggesting that the complex comprised of HIRA homologs mainly silences the transcription and/or destabilizes the transcripts of copy-2 genes. Further studies are required to determine how this complex contributes to the repression of histone gene transcription. The feedback up-regulation of copy-2 genes observed in <italic>&#x00394;ams2</italic> cells may be achieved through down-regulation of the level and/or activity of the Hip1&#x02013;Slm9 complex.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Ams2 GATA factor and HIRA homologs function for the periodic histone transcription</title><p>The results of the present study demonstrated that Ams2 GATA factor is an essential component of a transcriptional activator for all core histone genes during S-phase.

The 17-bp AACCCT-box [5&#x02032;-ATCA(C/A)AACCCTAACCCT-3&#x02032;] was identified previously as a common DNA sequence located upstream of core histone genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Although the AACCCT-box does not show a perfect match to the GATA consensus sequence, similar sequences (5&#x02032;-GATn-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GtTA-3&#x02032;) were found within the box in the reverse strand and are potential candidates for Ams2-binding sites. Alternatively, the AACCCT-box may be a binding site for proteins required for association of Ams2 with the promoter. Elimination of the AACCCT-box from the <italic>hht1<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>hhf1<sup>+</sup></italic> upstream region results in a marked reduction of promoter activity to the background level, suggesting that the AACCCT-box is essential for the promotion of histone gene transcription.</p><p>Ams2 is the first GATA factor reported to be involved in histone transcription. GATA factors are present in all eukaryotes, but it is not yet known whether similar GATA-type transcription factors are commonly utilized in histone gene regulation in different species. Some developmentally regulated GATA factors, such as GATA-4, are referred to as pioneer or decisive factors, because they function as determinants of tissue identity by opening compacted chromatin on tissue-specific promoters to aid access to the promoters by other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). To control developmentally programmed transcription, the expression of these molecules is known to be highly restricted during development. Similarly, Ams2 protein level is tightly regulated during the cell cycle, peaking at S-phase. Thus, Ams2 may be involved in the first remodeling step of nucleosomes on the histone promoters.</p><p>We also found that the fission yeast HIRA proteins, Hip1 and Slm9, down-regulate the basal levels of H3 and H4 gene expression. The effect on derepression of the histone transcription by HIRA-depletion was greater in cells at G2-phase than at S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), consistent with the previous report that HIRA functions in repressing histone transcription outside S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). As the levels of transcription of core histones were increased reproducibly at S-phase in both Hip1-null and Slm9-null cells, the cell cycle-dependent expression seems to be mediated through not only repression of the expression outside S-phase but also by positive activation at S-phase. In addition, it should be noted that, in Ams2-deficient cells, the levels of histone transcripts became constant across the cell cycle including S-phase. These observations might be explained by regulation of histone gene transcription by a combination of Ams2-dependent up-regulation at S-phase and non-periodic basal transcription down-regulated by the HIRA complex throughout the cell cycle. HIRA-depletion predominantly affects the repression of <italic>hht2<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>hhf2<sup>+</sup></italic> genes in copy-2, which show periodic expression with low amplitude.</p></sec><sec><title>Feedback regulation of reiterated histone H3-H4 genes</title><p>In this study, we clarified the transcriptional properties of individual histone H3 and H4 genes during the cell cycle. Copy-1 (<italic>hht1<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>hhf1<sup>+</sup></italic>) and copy-3 (<italic>hht3<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>hhf3<sup>+</sup></italic>) genes are predominantly transcribed in S-phase in wild-type cells. In contrast, copy-2 (<italic>hht2<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>hhf2<sup>+</sup></italic>) genes are transcribed throughout the cell cycle with relatively high levels of basal expression. We also demonstrated the existence of a feedback mechanism(s) differently up-regulating the reiterated histone H3-H4 gene pairs in Ams2-deficient cells. Ams2 is dispensable for cell viability, although S-phase-specific histone activation is severely compromised in such cells, presumably because non-periodic, basal histone transcription remains and is up-regulated in Ams2-null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The majority of Ams2-independent, non-periodic transcripts of histone H3 and H4 genes are likely supplied by <italic>hht2<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>hhf2<sup>+</sup></italic> genes in copy-2; copy-2 genes are expressed outside S-phase at relatively high levels in wild-type cells and are up-regulated in <italic>&#x00394;ams2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">6</xref>). These observations are consistent with the finding that Ams2-deletion mutants require copy-2 genes for cell viability (Figure S3). It has been reported that cells retaining only copy-1 genes (<italic>1 only</italic>) are notably sensitive to thiabendazole, a spindle poison, and cells retaining only copy-3 genes (<italic>3 only</italic>) show a temperature sensitive growth defect at 36&#x000b0;C. In contrast, cells retaining only copy-2 genes (<italic>2 only</italic>) showed no such sensitivities to thiabendazole or elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Non-periodic basal transcription of H3 and H4 genes, which is mainly from the copy-2 loci, may be an important component of the feedback regulation when cells encounter stresses that somehow perturb the normal progression of the cell cycle.</p><p>Among the three copies, copy-2 genes were the most up-regulated responded to the elimination of histone activation in S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). The feedback up-regulation of copy-2 and copy-3 but not copy-1 genes were detected responded to the reduction in copy number of H3-H4 pairs by gene disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). During G2-phase in the normal cell cycle, the basal levels of the copy-3 gene transcripts were up-regulated in Ams2 shut-off cells as well as those of copy-1 and copy-2 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). However, following release of Ams2-null cells from HU block, up-regulation of copy-3 genes was not detected in G2-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The feedback response of histone transcripts may be regulated differently according to changes in rates of DNA synthesis. These observations may indicate the existence of a variety of feedback modes for histone gene regulations. In budding yeast, deletion of one pair of H3-H4 genes does not affect the expression of other pairs of H3-H4 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), whereas the levels of histone H2A-H2B gene transcripts (HTA1-HTB1 and HTA2-HTB2 gene pairs) are controlled by either up-regulation of HTA1-HTB1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) or direct amplification of HTA2-HTB2 genes by circular chromosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). For the maintenance of genomic integrity, eukaryotic cells probably utilize several different mechanisms to compensate for histone dosage effects when perturbed.</p><p>One intriguing property of the divergent transcription of H3-H4 gene pairs is the asymmetric production of H3-H4 transcripts from copy-2 genes. The <italic>hht2<sup>+</sup></italic> transcript is present throughout the cell cycle, while the <italic>hhf2<sup>+</sup></italic> transcript is cell cycle regulated. As both <italic>hht2<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>hhf2<sup>+</sup></italic> genes are up-regulated by overproduction of Ams2, transcription of the <italic>hht2<sup>+</sup></italic> gene as well as the <italic>hhf2<sup>+</sup></italic> gene is probably promoted during S-phase. Thus, the transcript of <italic>hht2<sup>+</sup></italic> may be destabilized post-transcriptionally or may be suppressed by transcriptional repressors that abrogate Ams2-dependent activation. Further studies are required to determine how this asymmetric transcription of copy-2 genes is converted into meaningful physiological output.</p><p>Despite the identical amino acid sequences deduced from the three H3-H4 gene pairs, their differential transcription profiles may result in differences in timing of deposition of the histones encoded by these genes into the nucleosomes. Although recent experiments in higher eukaryotes have demonstrated that differences in a few amino acids between H3 and H3.3 can specify which nucleosome assembly pathway is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), the timing of the expression of H3 may be a more critical determinant for the timing of deposition into the nucleosomes in lower eukaryotes. Recently, it has been reported that, although remarkably similar in amino acid sequence, H3.1, H3.2 and H3.3 differ in their patterns of expression and the post-transcriptional modification in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It will be intriguing to investigate whether three histone H3 and H4 proteins in fission yeast are also differentially modified and whether the timing of their expression can influence their deposition.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p>
